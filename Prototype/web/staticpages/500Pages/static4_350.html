WARWICK 
Warwick may live to be the best of all.

SALISBURY 
Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,
Why Somerset should be preferred in this.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.

GLOUCESTER 
Madam, the king is old enough himself
To give his censure: these are no women's matters.

QUEEN MARGARET 
If he be old enough, what needs your grace
To be protector of his excellence?

GLOUCESTER 
Madam, I am protector of the realm;
And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.

SUFFOLK 
Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;
The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
And all the peers and nobles of the realm
Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.

CARDINAL 
The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
Are lank and lean with thy extortions.

SOMERSET 
Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
Have cost a mass of public treasury.

BUCKINGHAM 
Thy cruelty in execution
Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
And left thee to the mercy of the law.

QUEEN MARGARET 
They sale of offices and towns in France,
If they were known, as the suspect is great,
Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.

Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan

Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?

She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear

I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?

DUCHESS 
Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:
Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
I'd set my ten commandments in your face.

KING HENRY VI 
Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.

DUCHESS 
Against her will! good king, look to't in time;
She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:
Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.

Exit

BUCKINGHAM 
Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:
She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.

Exit

Re-enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER 
Now, lords, my choler being over-blown
With walking once about the quadrangle,
I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
As for your spiteful false objections,
Prove them, and I lie open to the law:
But God in mercy so deal with my soul,
As I in duty love my king and country!
But, to the matter that we have in hand:
I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
To be your regent in the realm of France.

SUFFOLK 
Before we make election, give me leave
To show some reason, of no little force,
That York is most unmeet of any man.

YORK 
I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
Next, if I be appointed for the place,
My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
Without discharge, money, or furniture,
Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:
Last time, I danced attendance on his will
Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.

WARWICK 
That can I witness; and a fouler fact
Did never traitor in the land commit.

SUFFOLK 
Peace, headstrong Warwick!

WARWICK 
Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?

Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man PETER, guarded

SUFFOLK 
Because here is a man accused of treason:
Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!

YORK 
Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?

KING HENRY VI 
What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?

SUFFOLK 
Please it your majesty, this is the man
That doth accuse his master of high treason:
His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
Was rightful heir unto the English crown
And that your majesty was a usurper.

KING HENRY VI 
Say, man, were these thy words?

HORNER 
An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor
thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am
falsely accused by the villain.

PETER 
By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to
me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
Lord of York's armour.

YORK 
Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
I do beseech your royal majesty,
Let him have all the rigor of the law.

HORNER 
Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.
My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct
him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his
knees he would be even with me: I have good
witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,
do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
accusation.

KING HENRY VI 
Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?

GLOUCESTER 
This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
Let Somerset be regent over the French,
Because in York this breeds suspicion:
And let these have a day appointed them
For single combat in convenient place,
For he hath witness of his servant's malice:
This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.

SOMERSET 
I humbly thank your royal majesty.

HORNER 
And I accept the combat willingly.

PETER 
Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity
my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O
Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to
fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!

GLOUCESTER 
Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.

KING HENRY VI 
Away with them to prison; and the day of combat
shall be the last of the next month. Come,
Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.

Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE IV. GLOUCESTER's garden.

Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and BOLINGBROKE 
HUME 
Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expects
performance of your promises.

BOLINGBROKE 
Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will her
ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?

HUME 
Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.

BOLINGBROKE 
I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,
Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be
busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,
and leave us.

Exit HUME

Mother Jourdain, be you
prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,
read you; and let us to our work.

Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following

DUCHESS 
Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this
gear the sooner the better.

BOLINGBROKE 
Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,
That time best fits the work we have in hand.
Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,
We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.

Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the circle; BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te, & c. It thunders and lightens terribly; then the Spirit riseth

Spirit 
Adsum.

MARGARET JOURDAIN 
Asmath,
By the eternal God, whose name and power
Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.

Spirit 
Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!

BOLINGBROKE 
'First of the king: what shall of him become?'

Reading out of a paper

Spirit 
The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
But him outlive, and die a violent death.

As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer

BOLINGBROKE 
'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'

Spirit 
By water shall he die, and take his end.

BOLINGBROKE 
'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'

Spirit 
Let him shun castles;
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Than where castles mounted stand.
Have done, for more I hardly can endure.

BOLINGBROKE 
Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
False fiend, avoid!

Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit

Enter YORK and BUCKINGHAM with their Guard and break in

YORK 
Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal
Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:
My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.

DUCHESS 
Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.

BUCKINGHAM 
True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.
And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
Stafford, take her to thee.

Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded

We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
All, away!

Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, & c

YORK 
Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
What have we here?

Reads

'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;
But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
Why, this is just
'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'
Well, to the rest:
'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
By water shall he die, and take his end.
What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
Let him shun castles;
Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
Than where castles mounted stand.'
Come, come, my lords;
These oracles are hardly attain'd,
And hardly understood.
The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,
With him the husband of this lovely lady:
Thither go these news, as fast as horse can
carry them:
A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.

BUCKINGHAM 
Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
To be the post, in hope of his reward.

YORK 
At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within
there, ho!

Enter a Servingman

Invite my Lords of Salisbury and Warwick
To sup with me to-morrow night. Away!

Exeunt


ACT II
SCENE I. Saint Alban's.

Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER, CARDINAL, and SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing 
QUEEN MARGARET 
Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
I saw not better sport these seven years' day:
Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;
And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.

KING HENRY VI 
But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
To see how God in all his creatures works!
Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.

SUFFOLK 
No marvel, an it like your majesty,
My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;
They know their master loves to be aloft,
And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.

GLOUCESTER 
My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.

CARDINAL 
I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.

GLOUCESTER 
Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?
Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?

KING HENRY VI 
The treasury of everlasting joy.

CARDINAL 
Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;
Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,
That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!

GLOUCESTER 
What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?
Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice;
With such holiness can you do it?

SUFFOLK 
No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.

GLOUCESTER 
As who, my lord?

SUFFOLK 
Why, as you, my lord,
An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.

GLOUCESTER 
Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.

QUEEN MARGARET 
And thy ambition, Gloucester.

KING HENRY VI 
I prithee, peace, good queen,
And whet not on these furious peers;
For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.

CARDINAL 
Let me be blessed for the peace I make,
Against this proud protector, with my sword!

GLOUCESTER 
[Aside to CARDINAL] Faith, holy uncle, would
'twere come to that!

CARDINAL 
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Marry, when thou darest.

GLOUCESTER 
[Aside to CARDINAL] Make up no factious
numbers for the matter;
In thine own person answer thy abuse.

CARDINAL 
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Ay, where thou darest
not peep: an if thou darest,
This evening, on the east side of the grove.

KING HENRY VI 
How now, my lords!

CARDINAL 
Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
We had had more sport.

Aside to GLOUCESTER

Come with thy two-hand sword.

GLOUCESTER 
True, uncle.

CARDINAL 
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Are ye advised? the
east side of the grove?

GLOUCESTER 
[Aside to CARDINAL] Cardinal, I am with you.

KING HENRY VI 
Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!

GLOUCESTER 
Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.

Aside to CARDINAL

Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,
Or all my fence shall fail.

CARDINAL 
[Aside to GLOUCESTER] Medice, teipsum--
Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.

KING HENRY VI 
The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
How irksome is this music to my heart!
When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.

Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!'

GLOUCESTER 
What means this noise?
Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?

Townsman 
A miracle! a miracle!

SUFFOLK 
Come to the king and tell him what miracle.

Townsman 
Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;
A man that ne'er saw in his life before.

KING HENRY VI 
Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!

Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following

CARDINAL 
Here comes the townsmen on procession,
To present your highness with the man.

KING HENRY VI 
Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.

GLOUCESTER 
Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.

KING HENRY VI 
Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?

SIMPCOX 
Born blind, an't please your grace.

Wife 
Ay, indeed, was he.

SUFFOLK 
What woman is this?

Wife 
His wife, an't like your worship.

GLOUCESTER 
Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have
better told.

KING HENRY VI 
Where wert thou born?

SIMPCOX 
At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.

KING HENRY VI 
Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:
Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
But still remember what the Lord hath done.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,
Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?

SIMPCOX 
God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,
By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,
Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'

Wife 
Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
Myself have heard a voice to call him so.

CARDINAL 
What, art thou lame?

SIMPCOX 
Ay, God Almighty help me!

SUFFOLK 
How camest thou so?

SIMPCOX 
A fall off of a tree.

Wife 
A plum-tree, master.

GLOUCESTER 
How long hast thou been blind?

SIMPCOX 
Born so, master.

GLOUCESTER 
What, and wouldst climb a tree?

SIMPCOX 
But that in all my life, when I was a youth.

Wife 
Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.

GLOUCESTER 
Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst
venture so.

SIMPCOX 
Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,
And made me climb, with danger of my life.

GLOUCESTER 
A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:
In my opinion yet thou seest not well.

SIMPCOX 
Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and
Saint Alban.

GLOUCESTER 
Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?

SIMPCOX 
Red, master; red as blood.

GLOUCESTER 
Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?

SIMPCOX 
Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.

KING HENRY VI 
Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?

SUFFOLK 
And yet, I think, jet did he never see.

GLOUCESTER 
But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.

Wife 
Never, before this day, in all his life.

GLOUCESTER 
Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?

SIMPCOX 
Alas, master, I know not.

GLOUCESTER 
What's his name?

SIMPCOX 
I know not.

GLOUCESTER 
Nor his?

SIMPCOX 
No, indeed, master.

GLOUCESTER 
What's thine own name?

SIMPCOX 
Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.

GLOUCESTER 
Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in
Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
name the several colours we do wear. Sight may
distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them
all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here
hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his
cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple
to his legs again?

SIMPCOX 
O master, that you could!

GLOUCESTER 
My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in
your town, and things called whips?

Mayor 
Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.

GLOUCESTER 
Then send for one presently.

Mayor 
Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.

Exit an Attendant

GLOUCESTER 
Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,
if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me
over this stool and run away.

SIMPCOX 
Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:
You go about to torture me in vain.

Enter a Beadle with whips

GLOUCESTER 
Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah
beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.

Beadle 
I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your
doublet quickly.

SIMPCOX 
Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.

After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!'

KING HENRY VI 
O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?

QUEEN MARGARET 
It made me laugh to see the villain run.

GLOUCESTER 
Follow the knave; and take this drab away.
