
DOLABELLA 
Most sovereign creature,--

CLEOPATRA 
His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
Crested the world: his voice was propertied
As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
That grew the more by reaping: his delights
Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
The element they lived in: in his livery
Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
As plates dropp'd from his pocket.

DOLABELLA 
Cleopatra!

CLEOPATRA 
Think you there was, or might be, such a man
As this I dream'd of?

DOLABELLA 
Gentle madam, no.

CLEOPATRA 
You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.

DOLABELLA 
Hear me, good madam.
Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
As answering to the weight: would I might never
O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
My very heart at root.

CLEOPATRA 
I thank you, sir,
Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

DOLABELLA 
I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

CLEOPATRA 
Nay, pray you, sir,--

DOLABELLA 
Though he be honourable,--

CLEOPATRA 
He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

DOLABELLA 
Madam, he will; I know't.

Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Which is the Queen of Egypt?

DOLABELLA 
It is the emperor, madam.

CLEOPATRA kneels

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Arise, you shall not kneel:
I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.

CLEOPATRA 
Sir, the gods
Will have it thus; my master and my lord
I must obey.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Take to you no hard thoughts:
The record of what injuries you did us,
Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
As things but done by chance.

CLEOPATRA 
Sole sir o' the world,
I cannot project mine own cause so well
To make it clear; but do confess I have
Been laden with like frailties which before
Have often shamed our sex.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Cleopatra, know,
We will extenuate rather than enforce:
If you apply yourself to our intents,
Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
A benefit in this change; but if you seek
To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
Of my good purposes, and put your children
To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

CLEOPATRA 
And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

CLEOPATRA 
This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

SELEUCUS 
Here, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
Upon his peril, that I have reserved
To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

SELEUCUS 
Madam,
I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
Speak that which is not.

CLEOPATRA 
What have I kept back?

SELEUCUS 
Enough to purchase what you have made known.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
Your wisdom in the deed.

CLEOPATRA 
See, Caesar! O, behold,
How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
O rarely base!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Good queen, let us entreat you.

CLEOPATRA 
O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
Doing the honour of thy lordliness
To one so meek, that mine own servant should
Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
That I some lady trifles have reserved,
Immoment toys, things of such dignity
As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
Some nobler token I have kept apart
For Livia and Octavia, to induce
Their mediation; must I be unfolded
With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
Beneath the fall I have.

To SELEUCUS

Prithee, go hence;
Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Forbear, Seleucus.

Exit SELEUCUS

CLEOPATRA 
Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
For things that others do; and, when we fall,
We answer others' merits in our name,
Are therefore to be pitied.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Cleopatra,
Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
For we intend so to dispose you as
Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
Our care and pity is so much upon you,
That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.

CLEOPATRA 
My master, and my lord!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Not so. Adieu.

Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train

CLEOPATRA 
He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.

Whispers CHARMIAN

IRAS 
Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
And we are for the dark.

CLEOPATRA 
Hie thee again:
I have spoke already, and it is provided;
Go put it to the haste.

CHARMIAN 
Madam, I will.

Re-enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA 
Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN 
Behold, sir.

Exit

CLEOPATRA 
Dolabella!

DOLABELLA 
Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
Which my love makes religion to obey,
I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
Intends his journey; and within three days
You with your children will he send before:
Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
Your pleasure and my promise.

CLEOPATRA 
Dolabella,
I shall remain your debtor.

DOLABELLA 
I your servant,
Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.

CLEOPATRA 
Farewell, and thanks.

Exit DOLABELLA

Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves
With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
And forced to drink their vapour.

IRAS 
The gods forbid!

CLEOPATRA 
Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
Extemporally will stage us, and present
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
I' the posture of a whore.

IRAS 
O the good gods!

CLEOPATRA 
Nay, that's certain.

IRAS 
I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
Are stronger than mine eyes.

CLEOPATRA 
Why, that's the way
To fool their preparation, and to conquer
Their most absurd intents.

Re-enter CHARMIAN

Now, Charmian!
Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
Wherefore's this noise?

Exit IRAS. A noise within

Enter a Guardsman

Guard 
Here is a rural fellow
That will not be denied your highness presence:
He brings you figs.

CLEOPATRA 
Let him come in.

Exit Guardsman

What poor an instrument
May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
Of woman in me: now from head to foot
I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
No planet is of mine.

Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket

Guard 
This is the man.

CLEOPATRA 
Avoid, and leave him.

Exit Guardsman

Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
That kills and pains not?

Clown 
Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
never recover.

CLEOPATRA 
Rememberest thou any that have died on't?

Clown 
Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
but something given to lie; as a woman should not
do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
worm's an odd worm.

CLEOPATRA 
Get thee hence; farewell.

Clown 
I wish you all joy of the worm.

Setting down his basket

CLEOPATRA 
Farewell.

Clown 
You must think this, look you, that the worm will
do his kind.

CLEOPATRA 
Ay, ay; farewell.

Clown 
Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
goodness in worm.

CLEOPATRA 
Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

Clown 
Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
not worth the feeding.

CLEOPATRA 
Will it eat me?

Clown 
You must not think I am so simple but I know the
devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
that they make, the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA 
Well, get thee gone; farewell.

Clown 
Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.

Exit

Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, & c

CLEOPATRA 
Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
Immortal longings in me: now no more
The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call; I see him rouse himself
To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
Now to that name my courage prove my title!
I am fire and air; my other elements
I give to baser life. So; have you done?
Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.

Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies

Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
If thou and nature can so gently part,
The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
It is not worth leave-taking.

CHARMIAN 
Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
The gods themselves do weep!

CLEOPATRA 
This proves me base:
If she first meet the curled Antony,
He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
mortal wretch,

To an asp, which she applies to her breast

With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
Unpolicied!

CHARMIAN 
O eastern star!

CLEOPATRA 
Peace, peace!
Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
That sucks the nurse asleep?

CHARMIAN 
O, break! O, break!

CLEOPATRA 
As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.

Applying another asp to her arm

What should I stay--

Dies

CHARMIAN 
In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
And golden Phoebus never be beheld
Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
I'll mend it, and then play.

Enter the Guard, rushing in

First Guard 
Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN 
Speak softly, wake her not.

First Guard 
Caesar hath sent--

CHARMIAN 
Too slow a messenger.

Applies an asp

O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

First Guard 
Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.

Second Guard 
There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.

First Guard 
What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?

CHARMIAN 
It is well done, and fitting for a princess
Descended of so many royal kings.
Ah, soldier!

Dies

Re-enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA 
How goes it here?

Second Guard 
All dead.

DOLABELLA 
Caesar, thy thoughts
Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
So sought'st to hinder.

Within 'A way there, a way for Caesar!'

Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching

DOLABELLA 
O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
That you did fear is done.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Bravest at the last,
She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
I do not see them bleed.

DOLABELLA 
Who was last with them?

First Guard 
A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
This was his basket.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Poison'd, then.

First Guard 
O Caesar,
This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
I found her trimming up the diadem
On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
And on the sudden dropp'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
O noble weakness!
If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
As she would catch another Antony
In her strong toil of grace.

DOLABELLA 
Here, on her breast,
There is a vent of blood and something blown:
The like is on her arm.

First Guard 
This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
Upon the caves of Nile.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Most probable
That so she died; for her physician tells me
She hath pursued conclusions infinite
Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
And bear her women from the monument:
She shall be buried by her Antony:
No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
A pair so famous. High events as these
Strike those that make them; and their story is
No less in pity than his glory which
Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
In solemn show attend this funeral;
And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
High order in this great solemnity.

ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO 
BERNARDO 
Who's there?

FRANCISCO 
Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO 
Long live the king!

FRANCISCO 
Bernardo?

BERNARDO 
He.

FRANCISCO 
You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO 
'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO 
For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO 
Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO 
Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO 
Well, good night.
If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO 
I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO 
Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS 
And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO 
Give you good night.

MARCELLUS 
O, farewell, honest soldier:
Who hath relieved you?

FRANCISCO 
Bernardo has my place.
Give you good night.

Exit

MARCELLUS 
Holla! Bernardo!

BERNARDO 
Say,
What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO 
A piece of him.

BERNARDO 
Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS 
What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO 
I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS 
Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
And will not let belief take hold of him
Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
Therefore I have entreated him along
With us to watch the minutes of this night;
That if again this apparition come,
He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HORATIO 
Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BERNARDO 
Sit down awhile;
And let us once again assail your ears,
That are so fortified against our story
What we have two nights seen.

HORATIO 
Well, sit we down,
And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

BERNARDO 
Last night of all,
When yond same star that's westward from the pole
Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
The bell then beating one,--

Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS 
Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

BERNARDO 
In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

MARCELLUS 
Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BERNARDO 
Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.
