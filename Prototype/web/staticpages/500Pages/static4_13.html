ACT IV
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die; meantime
Laugh at his challenge.

MECAENAS 
Caesar must think,
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction: never anger
Made good guard for itself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Let our best heads
Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight: within our files there are,
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

Exeunt

SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others 
MARK ANTONY 
He will not fight with me, Domitius.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
No.

MARK ANTONY 
Why should he not?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.

MARK ANTONY 
To-morrow, soldier,
By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

MARK ANTONY 
Well said; come on.
Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
Be bounteous at our meal.

Enter three or four Servitors

Give me thy hand,
Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
And kings have been your fellows.

CLEOPATRA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind.

MARK ANTONY 
And thou art honest too.
I wish I could be made so many men,
And all of you clapp'd up together in
An Antony, that I might do you service
So good as you have done.

All 
The gods forbid!

MARK ANTONY 
Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
As when mine empire was your fellow too,
And suffer'd my command.

CLEOPATRA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.

MARK ANTONY 
Tend me to-night;
May be it is the period of your duty:
Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
You'll serve another master. I look on you
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
I turn you not away; but, like a master
Married to your good service, stay till death:
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
And the gods yield you for't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What mean you, sir,
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
Transform us not to women.

MARK ANTONY 
Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall!
My hearty friends,
You take me in too dolorous a sense;
For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
And drown consideration.

Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.

Enter two Soldiers to their guard 
First Soldier 
Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.

Second Soldier 
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

First Soldier 
Nothing. What news?

Second Soldier 
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.

First Soldier 
Well, sir, good night.

Enter two other Soldiers

Second Soldier 
Soldiers, have careful watch.

Third Soldier 
And you. Good night, good night.

They place themselves in every corner of the stage

Fourth Soldier 
Here we: and if to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.

Third Soldier 
'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.

Music of the hautboys as under the stage

Fourth Soldier 
Peace! what noise?

First Soldier 
List, list!

Second Soldier 
Hark!

First Soldier 
Music i' the air.

Third Soldier 
Under the earth.

Fourth Soldier 
It signs well, does it not?

Third Soldier 
No.

First Soldier 
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?

Second Soldier 
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Now leaves him.

First Soldier 
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?

They advance to another post

Second Soldier 
How now, masters!

All 
[Speaking together] How now!
How now! do you hear this?

First Soldier 
Ay; is't not strange?

Third Soldier 
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?

First Soldier 
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.

All 
Content. 'Tis strange.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending 
MARK ANTONY 
Eros! mine armour, Eros!

CLEOPATRA 
Sleep a little.

MARK ANTONY 
No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!

Enter EROS with armour

Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
Because we brave her: come.

CLEOPATRA 
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?

MARK ANTONY 
Ah, let be, let be! thou art
The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.

CLEOPATRA 
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.

MARK ANTONY 
Well, well;
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defences.

EROS 
Briefly, sir.

CLEOPATRA 
Is not this buckled well?

MARK ANTONY 
Rarely, rarely:
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
A workman in't.

Enter an armed Soldier

Good morrow to thee; welcome:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to't with delight.

Soldier 
A thousand, sir,
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.

Shout. Trumpets flourish

Enter Captains and Soldiers

Captain 
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

All 
Good morrow, general.

MARK ANTONY 
'Tis well blown, lads:
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
That means to be of note, begins betimes.
So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable

Kisses her

And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers

CHARMIAN 
Please you, retire to your chamber.

CLEOPATRA 
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.

Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them 
Soldier 
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

MARK ANTONY 
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
To make me fight at land!

Soldier 
Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Follow'd thy heels.

MARK ANTONY 
Who's gone this morning?

Soldier 
Who!
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
Say 'I am none of thine.'

MARK ANTONY 
What say'st thou?

Soldier 
Sir,
He is with Caesar.

EROS 
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.

MARK ANTONY 
Is he gone?

Soldier 
Most certain.

MARK ANTONY 
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!

Exeunt

SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, and others 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
Our will is Antony be took alive;
Make it so known.

AGRIPPA 
Caesar, I shall.

Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
The time of universal peace is near:
Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
Shall bear the olive freely.

Enter a Messenger

Messenger 
Antony
Is come into the field.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Go charge Agrippa
Plant those that have revolted in the van,
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
Upon himself.

Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
And leave his master Antony: for this pains
Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment, but
No honourable trust. I have done ill;
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
That I will joy no more.

Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's

Soldier 
Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
His bounty overplus: the messenger
Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I give it you.

Soldier 
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.

Exit

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.

Exit

SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.

Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others 
AGRIPPA 
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.

Exeunt

Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded

SCARUS 
O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.

MARK ANTONY 
Thou bleed'st apace.

SCARUS 
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now 'tis made an H.

MARK ANTONY 
They do retire.

SCARUS 
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
Room for six scotches more.

Enter EROS

EROS 
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.

SCARUS 
Let us score their backs,
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
'Tis sport to maul a runner.

MARK ANTONY 
I will reward thee
Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
For thy good valour. Come thee on.

SCARUS 
I'll halt after.

Exeunt

SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.

Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS, with others 
MARK ANTONY 
We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
The honour'd gashes whole.

To SCARUS

Give me thy hand

Enter CLEOPATRA, attended

To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
Make her thanks bless thee.

To CLEOPATRA

O thou day o' the world,
Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing!

CLEOPATRA 
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?

MARK ANTONY 
My nightingale,
We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
though grey
Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
Destroy'd in such a shape.

CLEOPATRA 
I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

MARK ANTONY 
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together,
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
Applauding our approach.

Exeunt

SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Sentinels at their post 
First Soldier 
If we be not relieved within this hour,
We must return to the court of guard: the night
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.

Second Soldier 
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
O, bear me witness, night,--

Third Soldier 
What man is this?

Second Soldier 
Stand close, and list him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!

First Soldier 
Enobarbus!

Third Soldier 
Peace!
Hark further.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular;
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive:
O Antony! O Antony!

Dies

Second Soldier 
Let's speak To him.

First Soldier 
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.

Third Soldier 
Let's do so. But he sleeps.

First Soldier 
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.

Second Soldier 
Go we to him.

Third Soldier 
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

Second Soldier 
Hear you, sir?

First Soldier 
The hand of death hath raught him.

Drums afar off

Hark! the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
Is fully out.

Third Soldier 
Come on, then;
He may recover yet.

Exeunt with the body

SCENE X. Between the two camps.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army 
MARK ANTONY 
Their preparation is to-day by sea;
We please them not by land.

SCARUS 
For both, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven
Where their appointment we may best discover,
And look on their endeavour.

Exeunt

SCENE XI. Another part of the same.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
But being charged, we will be still by land,
Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
And hold our best advantage.

Exeunt

SCENE XII. Another part of the same.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS 
MARK ANTONY 
Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
does stand,
I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
Straight, how 'tis like to go.

Exit

SCARUS 
Swallows have built
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
Of what he has, and has not.

Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight

Re-enter MARK ANTONY

MARK ANTONY 
All is lost;
