What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make die with a restorative.

Kisses him

Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman 
[Within] Lead, boy: which way?

JULIET 
Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!

Snatching ROMEO's dagger

This is thy sheath;

Stabs herself

there rust, and let me die.

Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

PAGE 
This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

First Watchman 
The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain these two days buried.
Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.

Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

Second Watchman 
Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchman 
Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

Third Watchman 
Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
We took this mattock and this spade from him,
As he was coming from this churchyard side.

First Watchman 
A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

PRINCE 
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning's rest?

Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

CAPULET 
What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET 
The people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE 
What fear is this which startles in our ears?

First Watchman 
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE 
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

First Watchman 
Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
With instruments upon them, fit to open
These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET 
O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,--
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET 
O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

Enter MONTAGUE and others

PRINCE 
Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE 
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE 
Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE 
O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE 
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their
true descent;
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE 
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me of this direful murder;
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE 
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE 
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
To County Paris: then comes she to me,
And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
A sleeping potion; which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
That he should hither come as this dire night,
To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
Being the time the potion's force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking,
Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
And bear this work of heaven with patience:
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE 
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR 
I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE 
Give me the letter; I will look on it.
Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE 
He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
And by and by my master drew on him;
And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE 
This letter doth make good the friar's words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
And I for winking at your discords too
Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET 
O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
Can I demand.

MONTAGUE 
But I can give thee more:
For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
That while Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET 
As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE 
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

Exeunt
Antony and Cleopatra

ACT I
SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO 
PHILO 
Nay, but this dotage of our general's
O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
That o'er the files and musters of the war
Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy's lust.

Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her

Look, where they come:
Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
The triple pillar of the world transform'd
Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.

CLEOPATRA 
If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

MARK ANTONY 
There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

CLEOPATRA 
I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.

MARK ANTONY 
Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

Enter an Attendant

Attendant 
News, my good lord, from Rome.

MARK ANTONY 
Grates me: the sum.

CLEOPATRA 
Nay, hear them, Antony:
Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'

MARK ANTONY 
How, my love!

CLEOPATRA 
Perchance! nay, and most like:
You must not stay here longer, your dismission
Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

MARK ANTONY 
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair

Embracing

And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
On pain of punishment, the world to weet
We stand up peerless.

CLEOPATRA 
Excellent falsehood!
Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
Will be himself.

MARK ANTONY 
But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?

CLEOPATRA 
Hear the ambassadors.

MARK ANTONY 
Fie, wrangling queen!
Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
To weep; whose every passion fully strives
To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
No messenger, but thine; and all alone
To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.

Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train

DEMETRIUS 
Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?

PHILO 
Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.

DEMETRIUS 
I am full sorry
That he approves the common liar, who
Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. Another room.

Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer 
CHARMIAN 
Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
with garlands!

ALEXAS 
Soothsayer!

Soothsayer 
Your will?

CHARMIAN 
Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?

Soothsayer 
In nature's infinite book of secrecy
A little I can read.

ALEXAS 
Show him your hand.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
Cleopatra's health to drink.

CHARMIAN 
Good sir, give me good fortune.

Soothsayer 
I make not, but foresee.

CHARMIAN 
Pray, then, foresee me one.

Soothsayer 
You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

CHARMIAN 
He means in flesh.

IRAS 
No, you shall paint when you are old.

CHARMIAN 
Wrinkles forbid!

ALEXAS 
Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

CHARMIAN 
Hush!

Soothsayer 
You shall be more beloving than beloved.

CHARMIAN 
I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS 
Nay, hear him.

CHARMIAN 
Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

Soothsayer 
You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

CHARMIAN 
O excellent! I love long life better than figs.

Soothsayer 
You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
Than that which is to approach.

CHARMIAN 
Then belike my children shall have no names:
prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

Soothsayer 
If every of your wishes had a womb.
And fertile every wish, a million.

CHARMIAN 
Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

ALEXAS 
You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

CHARMIAN 
Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

ALEXAS 
We'll know all our fortunes.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
be--drunk to bed.

IRAS 
There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

CHARMIAN 
E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

IRAS 
Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

CHARMIAN 
Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
tell her but a worky-day fortune.

Soothsayer 
Your fortunes are alike.

IRAS 
But how, but how? give me particulars.

Soothsayer 
I have said.

IRAS 
Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

CHARMIAN 
Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
I, where would you choose it?

IRAS 
Not in my husband's nose.

CHARMIAN 
Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

IRAS 
Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

CHARMIAN 
Amen.

ALEXAS 
Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
they'ld do't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Hush! here comes Antony.

CHARMIAN 
Not he; the queen.

Enter CLEOPATRA

CLEOPATRA 
Saw you my lord?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
No, lady.

CLEOPATRA 
Was he not here?

CHARMIAN 
No, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Madam?

CLEOPATRA 
Seek him, and bring him hither.
Where's Alexas?

ALEXAS 
Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

CLEOPATRA 
We will not look upon him: go with us.

Exeunt

Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants

Messenger 
Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

MARK ANTONY 
Against my brother Lucius?

Messenger 
Ay:
But soon that war had end, and the time's state
Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
Upon the first encounter, drave them.

MARK ANTONY 
Well, what worst?

Messenger 
The nature of bad news infects the teller.

MARK ANTONY 
When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
I hear him as he flatter'd.

Messenger 
Labienus--
This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
Extended Asia from Euphrates;
His conquering banner shook from Syria
To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--

MARK ANTONY 
Antony, thou wouldst say,--

Messenger 
O, my lord!

MARK ANTONY 
Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
With such full licence as both truth and malice
Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

Messenger 
At your noble pleasure.

Exit

MARK ANTONY 
From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

First Attendant 
The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?

Second Attendant 
He stays upon your will.

MARK ANTONY 
Let him appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
Or lose myself in dotage.

Enter another Messenger

What are you?

Second Messenger 
Fulvia thy wife is dead.

MARK ANTONY 
Where died she?

Second Messenger 
In Sicyon:
Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
Importeth thee to know, this bears.

Gives a letter

MARK ANTONY 
Forbear me.

Exit Second Messenger

There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
I must from this enchanting queen break off:
Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!

Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What's your pleasure, sir?

MARK ANTONY 
I must with haste from hence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Why, then, we kill all our women:
we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

MARK ANTONY 
I must be gone.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
her, she hath such a celerity in dying.

MARK ANTONY 
She is cunning past man's thought.

Exit ALEXAS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
shower of rain as well as Jove.

MARK ANTONY 
Would I had never seen her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
of work; which not to have been blest withal would
have discredited your travel.

MARK ANTONY 
Fulvia is dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Sir?

MARK ANTONY 
Fulvia is dead.
