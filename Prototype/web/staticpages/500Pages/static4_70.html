CORIOLANUS 
Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen 
You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
the common people.

CORIOLANUS 
You should account me the more virtuous that I have
not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
the insinuating nod and be off to them most
counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
bewitchment of some popular man and give it
bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen 
We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
you our voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen 
You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS 
I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens 
The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

Exeunt

CORIOLANUS 
Most sweet voices!
Better it is to die, better to starve,
Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
And mountainous error be too highly heapt
For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
Let the high office and the honour go
To one that would do thus. I am half through;
The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.

Re-enter three Citizens more

Here come more voices.
Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen 
He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
man's voice.

Seventh Citizen 
Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
and make him good friend to the people!

All Citizens 
Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

Exeunt

CORIOLANUS 
Worthy voices!

Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

MENENIUS 
You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
Endue you with the people's voice: remains
That, in the official marks invested, you
Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS 
Is this done?

SICINIUS 
The custom of request you have discharged:
The people do admit you, and are summon'd
To meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS 
Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS 
There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS 
May I change these garments?

SICINIUS 
You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS 
That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS 
I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS 
We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS 
Fare you well.

Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS

He has it now, and by his looks methink
'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS 
With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
will you dismiss the people?

Re-enter Citizens

SICINIUS 
How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen 
He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS 
We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen 
Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen 
Certainly
He flouted us downright.

First Citizen 
No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.

Second Citizen 
Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS 
Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens 
No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen 
He said he had wounds, which he could show
in private;
And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
But by your voices, will not so permit me;
Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
Your most sweet voices: now you have left
your voices,
I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS 
Why either were you ignorant to see't,
Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
To yield your voices?

BRUTUS 
Could you not have told him
As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
But was a petty servant to the state,
He was your enemy, ever spake against
Your liberties and the charters that you bear
I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
A place of potency and sway o' the state,
If he should still malignantly remain
Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
Would think upon you for your voices and
Translate his malice towards you into love,
Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS 
Thus to have said,
As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
Either his gracious promise, which you might,
As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
Which easily endures not article
Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS 
Did you perceive
He did solicit you in free contempt
When he did need your loves, and do you think
That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS 
Have you
Ere now denied the asker? and now again
Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen 
He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen 
And will deny him:
I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

First Citizen 
I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

BRUTUS 
Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
They have chose a consul that will from them take
Their liberties; make them of no more voice
Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS 
Let them assemble,
And on a safer judgment all revoke
Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
Thinking upon his services, took from you
The apprehension of his present portance,
Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS 
Lay
A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
No impediment between, but that you must
Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS 
Say, you chose him
More after our commandment than as guided
By your own true affections, and that your minds,
Preoccupied with what you rather must do
Than what you should, made you against the grain
To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS 
Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
How youngly he began to serve his country,
How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,
Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,
Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS 
One thus descended,
That hath beside well in his person wrought
To be set high in place, we did commend
To your remembrances: but you have found,
Scaling his present bearing with his past,
That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
Your sudden approbation.

BRUTUS 
Say, you ne'er had done't--
Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
And presently, when you have drawn your number,
Repair to the Capitol.

All 
We will so: almost all
Repent in their election.

Exeunt Citizens

BRUTUS 
Let them go on;
This mutiny were better put in hazard,
Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
With their refusal, both observe and answer
The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS 
To the Capitol, come:
We will be there before the stream o' the people;
And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
Which we have goaded onward.

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators 
CORIOLANUS 
Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS 
He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
Our swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS 
So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
Upon's again.

COMINIUS 
They are worn, lord consul, so,
That we shall hardly in our ages see
Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS 
Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS 
On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS 
Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS 
He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS 
How? what?

LARTIUS 
How often he had met you, sword to sword;
That of all things upon the earth he hated
Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
To hopeless restitution, so he might
Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS 
At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS 
At Antium.

CORIOLANUS 
I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.

Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
For they do prank them in authority,
Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS 
Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS 
Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS 
It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS 
What makes this change?

MENENIUS 
The matter?

COMINIUS 
Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS 
Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS 
Have I had children's voices?

First Senator 
Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS 
The people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS 
Stop,
Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS 
Are these your herd?
Must these have voices, that can yield them now
And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
your offices?
You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS 
Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS 
It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
To curb the will of the nobility:
Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS 
Call't not a plot:
The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS 
Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS 
Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS 
Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS 
How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS 
You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS 
Not unlike,
Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS 
Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS 
You show too much of that
For which the people stir: if you will pass
To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
Or never be so noble as a consul,
Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS 
Let's be calm.

COMINIUS 
The people are abused; set on. This paltering
Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
I' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS 
Tell me of corn!
This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

MENENIUS 
Not now, not now.

First Senator 
Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS 
Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
I crave their pardons:
For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
Regard me as I do not flatter, and
Therein behold themselves: I say again,
In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
and scatter'd,
By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
Which they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS 
Well, no more.

First Senator 
No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS 
How! no more!
As for my country I have shed my blood,
Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
Coin words till their decay against those measles,
Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS 
You speak o' the people,
As if you were a god to punish, not
A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS 
'Twere well
We let the people know't.

MENENIUS 
What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS 
Choler!
Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS 
It is a mind
That shall remain a poison where it is,
Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS 
Shall remain!
Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS 
'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS 
'Shall'!
O good but most unwise patricians! why,
You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
And make your channel his? If he have power
Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
Be not as common fools; if you are not,
Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
If they be senators: and they are no less,
When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
To know, when two authorities are up,
Neither supreme, how soon confusion
May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
The one by the other.

COMINIUS 
Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS 
Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
Sometime in Greece,--

MENENIUS 
Well, well, no more of that.

CORIOLANUS 
Though there the people had more absolute power,
I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS 
Why, shall the people give
One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS 
I'll give my reasons,
More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
Was not our recompense, resting well assured
That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
Which they have often made against the senate,
All cause unborn, could never be the motive
Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
How shall this bisson multitude digest
The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
We are the greater poll, and in true fear
They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
The nature of our seats and make the rabble
Call our cares fears; which will in time
Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS 
Come, enough.

BRUTUS 
Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS 
No, take more:
What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
Of general ignorance,--it must omit
Real necessities, and give way the while
To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
it follows,
Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
You that will be less fearful than discreet,
That love the fundamental part of state
More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
A noble life before a long, and wish
To jump a body with a dangerous physic
That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
Of that integrity which should become't,
Not having the power to do the good it would,
For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS 
Has said enough.

SICINIUS 
Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
As traitors do.

CORIOLANUS 
Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
On whom depending, their obedience fails
To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS 
Manifest treason!

SICINIUS 
This a consul? no.

BRUTUS 
The aediles, ho!

Enter an AEdile

Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS 
Go, call the people:

Exit AEdile

in whose name myself
Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS 
Hence, old goat!
Senators, & C We'll surety him.

COMINIUS 
Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS 
Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS 
Help, ye citizens!

Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles

MENENIUS 
On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS 
Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS 
Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens 
Down with him! down with him!
Senators, & C Weapons, weapons, weapons!

They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying

'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS 
What is about to be? I am out of breath;
Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS 
Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens 
Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
