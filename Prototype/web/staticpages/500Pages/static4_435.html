tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
now she sings in heaven.

Second Lord 
How is this justified?

First Lord 
The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
makes her story true, even to the point of her
death: her death itself, which could not be her
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
the rector of the place.

Second Lord 
Hath the count all this intelligence?

First Lord 
Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
point, so to the full arming of the verity.

Second Lord 
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.

First Lord 
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!

Second Lord 
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample.

First Lord 
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.

Enter a Messenger

How now! where's your master?

Servant 
He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
morning for France. The duke hath offered him
letters of commendations to the king.

Second Lord 
They shall be no more than needful there, if they
were more than they can commend.

First Lord 
They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
Here's his lordship now.

Enter BERTRAM

How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?

BERTRAM 
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
that I have not ended yet.

Second Lord 
If the business be of any difficulty, and this
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
your lordship.

BERTRAM 
I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

Second Lord 
Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
poor gallant knave.

BERTRAM 
No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

Second Lord 
I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?

BERTRAM 
Nothing of me, has a'?

Second Lord 
His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
are, you must have the patience to hear it.

Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier

BERTRAM 
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
me: hush, hush!

First Lord 
Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa

First Soldier 
He calls for the tortures: what will you say
without 'em?

PAROLLES 
I will confess what I know without constraint: if
ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

First Soldier 
Bosko chimurcho.

First Lord 
Boblibindo chicurmurco.

First Soldier 
You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.

PAROLLES 
And truly, as I hope to live.

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse the
duke is strong.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES 
Five or six thousand; but very weak and
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
and credit and as I hope to live.

First Soldier 
Shall I set down your answer so?

PAROLLES 
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.

BERTRAM 
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

First Lord 
You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
his dagger.

Second Lord 
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
by wearing his apparel neatly.

First Soldier 
Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES 
Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.

First Lord 
He's very near the truth in this.

BERTRAM 
But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
delivers it.

PAROLLES 
Poor rogues, I pray you, say.

First Soldier 
Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES 
I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
rogues are marvellous poor.

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are
a-foot.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES 
By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.

BERTRAM 
What shall be done to him?

First Lord 
Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
condition, and what credit I have with the duke.

First Soldier 
Well, that's set down.

Reads

'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
do you know of it?

PAROLLES 
I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.

First Soldier 
Do you know this Captain Dumain?

PAROLLES 
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
say him nay.

BERTRAM 
Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

First Soldier 
Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?

PAROLLES 
Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

First Lord 
Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
lordship anon.

First Soldier 
What is his reputation with the duke?

PAROLLES 
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.

First Soldier 
Marry, we'll search.

PAROLLES 
In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
in my tent.

First Soldier 
Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?

PAROLLES 
I do not know if it be it or no.

BERTRAM 
Our interpreter does it well.

First Lord 
Excellently.

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--

PAROLLES 
That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.

First Soldier 
Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.

PAROLLES 
My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.

BERTRAM 
Damnable both-sides rogue!

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
After he scores, he never pays the score:
Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
PAROLLES.'

BERTRAM 
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
in's forehead.

Second Lord 
This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
linguist and the armipotent soldier.

BERTRAM 
I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
he's a cat to me.

First Soldier 
I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
fain to hang you.

PAROLLES 
My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
die; but that, my offences being many, I would
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.

First Soldier 
We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
his valour: what is his honesty?

PAROLLES 
He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
such volubility, that you would think truth were a
fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
every thing that an honest man should not have; what
an honest man should have, he has nothing.

First Lord 
I begin to love him for this.

BERTRAM 
For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
him for me, he's more and more a cat.

First Soldier 
What say you to his expertness in war?

PAROLLES 
Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
this I am not certain.

First Lord 
He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
rarity redeems him.

BERTRAM 
A pox on him, he's a cat still.

First Soldier 
His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.

PAROLLES 
Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
succession for it perpetually.

First Soldier 
What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?

Second Lord 
Why does be ask him of me?

First Soldier 
What's he?

PAROLLES 
E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
on he has the cramp.

First Soldier 
If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
the Florentine?

PAROLLES 
Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.

First Soldier 
I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.

PAROLLES 
[Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?

First Soldier 
There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
general says, you that have so traitorously
discovered the secrets of your army and made such
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.

PAROLLES 
O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!

First Lord 
That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.

Unblinding him

So, look about you: know you any here?

BERTRAM 
Good morrow, noble captain.

Second Lord 
God bless you, Captain Parolles.

First Lord 
God save you, noble captain.

Second Lord 
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
I am for France.

First Lord 
Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
but fare you well.

Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords

First Soldier 
You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
has a knot on't yet

PAROLLES 
Who cannot be crushed with a plot?

First Soldier 
If you could find out a country where but women were
that had received so much shame, you might begin an
impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
too: we shall speak of you there.

Exit with Soldiers

PAROLLES 
Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
As captain shall: simply the thing I am
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
that every braggart shall be found an ass.
Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
There's place and means for every man alive.
I'll after them.

Exit

SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.

Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA 
HELENA 
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
One of the greatest in the Christian world
Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
Time was, I did him a desired office,
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
We have convenient convoy. You must know
I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
And by the leave of my good lord the king,
We'll be before our welcome.

Widow 
Gentle madam,
You never had a servant to whose trust
Your business was more welcome.

HELENA 
Nor you, mistress,
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
As it hath fated her to be my motive
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
With what it loathes for that which is away.
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
Something in my behalf.

DIANA 
Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions, I am yours
Upon your will to suffer.

HELENA 
Yet, I pray you:
But with the word the time will bring on summer,
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:
All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown 
LAFEU 
No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

COUNTESS 
I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
could not have owed her a more rooted love.

LAFEU 
'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.

Clown 
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

LAFEU 
They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.

Clown 
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
skill in grass.

LAFEU 
Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?

Clown 
A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.

LAFEU 
Your distinction?

Clown 
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.

LAFEU 
So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

Clown 
And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.

LAFEU 
I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.

Clown 
At your service.

LAFEU 
No, no, no.

Clown 
Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
great a prince as you are.

LAFEU 
Who's that? a Frenchman?

Clown 
Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
is more hotter in France than there.

LAFEU 
What prince is that?

Clown 
The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
darkness; alias, the devil.

LAFEU 
Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
serve him still.

Clown 
I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
leads to the broad gate and the great fire.

LAFEU 
Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
looked to, without any tricks.

Clown 
If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.

Exit

LAFEU 
A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

COUNTESS 
So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.

LAFEU 
I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
conceived against your son, there is no fitter
matter. How does your ladyship like it?

COUNTESS 
With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
happily effected.

LAFEU 
His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
intelligence hath seldom failed.

COUNTESS 
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
die. I have letters that my son will be here
to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
with me till they meet together.

LAFEU 
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
safely be admitted.

COUNTESS 
You need but plead your honourable privilege.

LAFEU 
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
thank my God it holds yet.

Re-enter Clown

Clown 
O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
half, but his right cheek is worn bare.

LAFEU 
A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
of honour; so belike is that.

Clown 
But it is your carbonadoed face.

LAFEU 
Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
with the young noble soldier.

Clown 
Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
