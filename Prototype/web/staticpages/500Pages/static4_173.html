A marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS 
True, so I am.

Third Servingman 
Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS 
Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.

Pushes him away

Third Servingman 
What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
strange guest he has here.

Second Servingman 
And I shall.

Exit

Third Servingman 
Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS 
Under the canopy.

Third Servingman 
Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS 
Ay.

Third Servingman 
Where's that?

CORIOLANUS 
I' the city of kites and crows.

Third Servingman 
I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS 
No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingman 
How, sir! do you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS 
Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
trencher, hence!

Beats him away. Exit third Servingman

Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman

AUFIDIUS 
Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman 
Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
disturbing the lords within.

Retires

AUFIDIUS 
Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS 
If, Tullus,

Unmuffling

Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
Think me for the man I am, necessity
Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS 
What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS 
A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS 
Say, what's thy name?
Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS 
Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS 
I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS 
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed
thee straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee, for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS 
O Marcius, Marcius!
Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
I loved the maid I married; never man
Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands;
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepared against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS 
You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS 
Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
The leading of thine own revenges, take
The one half of my commission; and set down--
As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
Let me commend thee first to those that shall
Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward

First Servingman 
Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman 
By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
false report of him.

First Servingman 
What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman 
Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
cannot tell how to term it.

First Servingman 
He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
but I thought there was more in him than I could think.

Second Servingman 
So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
man i' the world.

First Servingman 
I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

Second Servingman 
Who, my master?

First Servingman 
Nay, it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman 
Worth six on him.

First Servingman 
Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
greater soldier.

Second Servingman 
Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

First Servingman 
Ay, and for an assault too.

Re-enter third Servingman

Third Servingman 
O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Servingman Second Servingman 
What, what, what? let's partake.

Third Servingman 
I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
lieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman Second Servingman 
Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman 
Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
Caius Marcius.

First Servingman 
Why do you say 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman 
I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
good enough for him.

Second Servingman 
Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman 
He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
him like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman 
An he had been cannibally given, he might have
broiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman 
But, more of thy news?

Third Servingman 
Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
question asked him by any of the senators, but they
stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
the middle and but one half of what he was
yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman 
And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman 
Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman 
Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman 
But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
and the man in blood, they will out of their
burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
him.

First Servingman 
But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman 
To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
wipe their lips.

Second Servingman 
Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman 
Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman 
'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman 
Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

Third Servingman 
Reason; because they then less need one another.
The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

All 
In, in, in, in!

Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.

Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS 
SICINIUS 
We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
His remedies are tame i' the present peace
And quietness of the people, which before
Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS 
We stood to't in good time.

Enter MENENIUS

Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS 
'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes 
Hail sir!

MENENIUS 
Hail to you both!

SICINIUS 
Your Coriolanus
Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS 
All's well; and might have been much better, if
He could have temporized.

SICINIUS 
Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS 
Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
Hear nothing from him.

Enter three or four Citizens

Citizens 
The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS 
God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS 
God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

First Citizen 
Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
Are bound to pray for you both.

SICINIUS 
Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS 
Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
Had loved you as we did.

Citizens 
Now the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes 
Farewell, farewell.

Exeunt Citizens

SICINIUS 
This is a happier and more comely time
Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
Crying confusion.

BRUTUS 
Caius Marcius was
A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
Self-loving,--

SICINIUS 
And affecting one sole throne,
Without assistance.

MENENIUS 
I think not so.

SICINIUS 
We should by this, to all our lamentation,
If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS 
The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
Sits safe and still without him.

Enter an AEdile

AEdile 
Worthy tribunes,
There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
And with the deepest malice of the war
Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS 
'Tis Aufidius,
Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS 
Come, what talk you
Of Marcius?

BRUTUS 
Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS 
Cannot be!
We have record that very well it can,
And three examples of the like have been
Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
Before you punish him, where he heard this,
Lest you shall chance to whip your information
And beat the messenger who bids beware
Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS 
Tell not me:
I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS 
Not possible.

Enter a Messenger

Messenger 
The nobles in great earnestness are going
All to the senate-house: some news is come
That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS 
'Tis this slave;--
Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
Nothing but his report.

Messenger 
Yes, worthy sir,
The slave's report is seconded; and more,
More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS 
What more fearful?

Messenger 
It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
And vows revenge as spacious as between
The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS 
This is most likely!

BRUTUS 
Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS 
The very trick on't.

MENENIUS 
This is unlikely:
He and Aufidius can no more atone
Than violentest contrariety.

Enter a second Messenger

Second Messenger 
You are sent for to the senate:
A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
Associated with Aufidius, rages
Upon our territories; and have already
O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
What lay before them.

Enter COMINIUS

COMINIUS 
O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS 
What news? what news?

COMINIUS 
You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
To melt the city leads upon your pates,
To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS 
What's the news? what's the news?

COMINIUS 
Your temples burned in their cement, and
Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS 
Pray now, your news?
You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS 
If!
He is their god: he leads them like a thing
Made by some other deity than nature,
That shapes man better; and they follow him,
Against us brats, with no less confidence
Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS 
You have made good work,
You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
on the voice of occupation and
The breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS 
He will shake
Your Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS 
As Hercules
Did shake down mellow fruit.
You have made fair work!

BRUTUS 
But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS 
Ay; and you'll look pale
Before you find it other. All the regions
Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS 
We are all undone, unless
The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS 
Who shall ask it?
The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
As those should do that had deserved his hate,
And therein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS 
'Tis true:
If he were putting to my house the brand
That should consume it, I have not the face
To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS 
You have brought
A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes 
Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS 
How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
Who did hoot him out o' the city.

COMINIUS 
But I fear
They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
The second name of men, obeys his points
As if he were his officer: desperation
Is all the policy, strength and defence,
That Rome can make against them.

Enter a troop of Citizens

MENENIUS 
Here come the clusters.
And is Aufidius with him? You are they
That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
And not a hair upon a soldier's head
Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
if he could burn us all into one coal,
We have deserved it.

Citizens 
Faith, we hear fearful news.

First Citizen 
For mine own part,
When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen 
And so did I.

Third Citizen 
And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
it was against our will.

COMINIUS 
Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUS 
You have made
Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

COMINIUS 
O, ay, what else?

Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS

SICINIUS 
Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
These are a side that would be glad to have
This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
And show no sign of fear.

First Citizen 
The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
him.

Second Citizen 
So did we all. But, come, let's home.

Exeunt Citizens

BRUTUS 
I do not like this news.

SICINIUS 
Nor I.

BRUTUS 
Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
Would buy this for a lie!

SICINIUS 
Pray, let us go.

Exeunt
