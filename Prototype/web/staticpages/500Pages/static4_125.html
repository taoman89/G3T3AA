me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
any convenience, an he were double and double a
lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.

Re-enter LAFEU

LAFEU 
Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news
for you: you have a new mistress.

PAROLLES 
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
lord: whom I serve above is my master.

LAFEU 
Who? God?

PAROLLES 
Ay, sir.

LAFEU 
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

PAROLLES 
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

LAFEU 
Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
and honourable personages than the commission of your
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.

Exit

PAROLLES 
Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
let it be concealed awhile.

Re-enter BERTRAM

BERTRAM 
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

PAROLLES 
What's the matter, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM 
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
I will not bed her.

PAROLLES 
What, what, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM 
O my Parolles, they have married me!
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

PAROLLES 
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

BERTRAM 
There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
I know not yet.

PAROLLES 
Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
He wears his honour in a box unseen,
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
Therefore, to the war!

BERTRAM 
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
That which I durst not speak; his present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife.

PAROLLES 
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

BERTRAM 
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

PAROLLES 
Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.

Enter HELENA and Clown 
HELENA 
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

Clown 
She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
world; but yet she is not well.

HELENA 
If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
not very well?

Clown 
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

HELENA 
What two things?

Clown 
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
God send her quickly!

Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES 
Bless you, my fortunate lady!

HELENA 
I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
good fortunes.

PAROLLES 
You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

Clown 
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
I would she did as you say.

PAROLLES 
Why, I say nothing.

Clown 
Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
is within a very little of nothing.

PAROLLES 
Away! thou'rt a knave.

Clown 
You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
been truth, sir.

PAROLLES 
Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

Clown 
Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
and much fool may you find in you, even to the
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

PAROLLES 
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
A very serious business calls on him.
The great prerogative and rite of love,
Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
Which they distil now in the curbed time,
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
And pleasure drown the brim.

HELENA 
What's his will else?

PAROLLES 
That you will take your instant leave o' the king
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
Strengthen'd with what apology you think
May make it probable need.

HELENA 
What more commands he?

PAROLLES 
That, having this obtain'd, you presently
Attend his further pleasure.

HELENA 
In every thing I wait upon his will.

PAROLLES 
I shall report it so.

HELENA 
I pray you.

Exit PAROLLES

Come, sirrah.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Paris. The KING's palace.

Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM 
LAFEU 
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

BERTRAM 
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

LAFEU 
You have it from his own deliverance.

BERTRAM 
And by other warranted testimony.

LAFEU 
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.

BERTRAM 
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
knowledge and accordingly valiant.

LAFEU 
I have then sinned against his experience and
transgressed against his valour; and my state that
way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
us friends; I will pursue the amity.

Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES 
[To BERTRAM] These things shall be done, sir.

LAFEU 
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

PAROLLES 
Sir?

LAFEU 
O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
workman, a very good tailor.

BERTRAM 
[Aside to PAROLLES] Is she gone to the king?

PAROLLES 
She is.

BERTRAM 
Will she away to-night?

PAROLLES 
As you'll have her.

BERTRAM 
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
Given order for our horses; and to-night,
When I should take possession of the bride,
End ere I do begin.

LAFEU 
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.

BERTRAM 
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

PAROLLES 
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
displeasure.

LAFEU 
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and
out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
question for your residence.

BERTRAM 
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

LAFEU 
And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.

Exit

PAROLLES 
An idle lord. I swear.

BERTRAM 
I think so.

PAROLLES 
Why, do you not know him?

BERTRAM 
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

Enter HELENA

HELENA 
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
For present parting; only he desires
Some private speech with you.

BERTRAM 
I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
The ministration and required office
On my particular. Prepared I was not
For such a business; therefore am I found
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
That presently you take our way for home;
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
For my respects are better than they seem
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not. This to my mother:

Giving a letter

'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
I leave you to your wisdom.

HELENA 
Sir, I can nothing say,
But that I am your most obedient servant.

BERTRAM 
Come, come, no more of that.

HELENA 
And ever shall
With true observance seek to eke out that
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
To equal my great fortune.

BERTRAM 
Let that go:
My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

HELENA 
Pray, sir, your pardon.

BERTRAM 
Well, what would you say?

HELENA 
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own.

BERTRAM 
What would you have?

HELENA 
Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
Faith yes;
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

BERTRAM 
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

HELENA 
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

BERTRAM 
Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.

Exit HELENA

Go thou toward home; where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.

PAROLLES 
Bravely, coragio!

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. Florence. The DUKE's palace.

Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers. 
DUKE 
So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war,
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.

First Lord 
Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
On the opposer.

DUKE 
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.

Second Lord 
Good my lord,
The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
But like a common and an outward man,
That the great figure of a council frames
By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guess'd.

DUKE 
Be it his pleasure.

First Lord 
But I am sure the younger of our nature,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic.

DUKE 
Welcome shall they be;
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell:
To-morrow to the field.

Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS and Clown 
COUNTESS 
It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
that he comes not along with her.

Clown 
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
melancholy man.

COUNTESS 
By what observance, I pray you?

Clown 
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

COUNTESS 
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

Opening a letter

Clown 
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

COUNTESS 
What have we here?

Clown 
E'en that you have there.

Exit

COUNTESS 
[Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
before the report come. If there be breadth enough
in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
to you. Your unfortunate son,
BERTRAM.
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
To fly the favours of so good a king;
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire.

Re-enter Clown

Clown 
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
soldiers and my young lady!

COUNTESS 
What is the matter?

Clown 
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
thought he would.

COUNTESS 
Why should he be killed?

Clown 
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
men, though it be the getting of children. Here
they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
hear your son was run away.

Exit

Enter HELENA, and two Gentlemen

First Gentleman 
Save you, good madam.

HELENA 
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

Second Gentleman 
Do not say so.

COUNTESS 
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
That the first face of neither, on the start,
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

Second Gentleman 
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
Thither we bend again.

HELENA 
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

Reads

When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
of thy body that I am father to, then call me
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
This is a dreadful sentence.

COUNTESS 
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

First Gentleman 
Ay, madam;
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.

COUNTESS 
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

Second Gentleman 
Ay, madam.

COUNTESS 
And to be a soldier?

Second Gentleman 
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
The duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims.

COUNTESS 
Return you thither?

First Gentleman 
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

HELENA 
[Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
'Tis bitter.

COUNTESS 
Find you that there?

HELENA 
Ay, madam.

First Gentleman 
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
heart was not consenting to.

COUNTESS 
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

First Gentleman 
A servant only, and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known.

COUNTESS 
Parolles, was it not?

First Gentleman 
Ay, my good lady, he.

COUNTESS 
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.

First Gentleman 
Indeed, good lady,
The fellow has a deal of that too much,
Which holds him much to have.

COUNTESS 
You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.

Second Gentleman 
We serve you, madam,
In that and all your worthiest affairs.

COUNTESS 
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near!

Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen

HELENA 
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
His death was so effected: better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
My being here it is that holds thee hence:
Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
The air of paradise did fan the house
And angels officed all: I will be gone,
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

Exit

SCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.

Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets 
DUKE 
The general of our horse thou art; and we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.

BERTRAM 
Sir, it is
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To the extreme edge of hazard.

DUKE 
Then go thou forth;
And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
As thy auspicious mistress!

BERTRAM 
This very day,
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
