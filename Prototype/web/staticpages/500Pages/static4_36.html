What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

First Merchant 
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

First Merchant 
Sir, I commend you to your own content.

Exit

ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

Exit

ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

Exit


ACT II
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA 
ADRIANA 
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

LUCIANA 
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
A man is master of his liberty:
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

ADRIANA 
Why should their liberty than ours be more?

LUCIANA 
Because their business still lies out o' door.

ADRIANA 
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

LUCIANA 
O, know he is the bridle of your will.

ADRIANA 
There's none but asses will be bridled so.

LUCIANA 
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.

ADRIANA 
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

LUCIANA 
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

ADRIANA 
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA 
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

ADRIANA 
How if your husband start some other where?

LUCIANA 
Till he come home again, I would forbear.

ADRIANA 
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
As much or more would we ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

LUCIANA 
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

ADRIANA 
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
can witness.

ADRIANA 
Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA 
Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
understand them.

ADRIANA 
But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA 
Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

LUCIANA 
Quoth who?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Quoth my master:
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA 
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA 
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
And he will bless that cross with other beating:
Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA 
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

Exit

LUCIANA 
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

ADRIANA 
His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA 
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

ADRIANA 
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

LUCIANA 
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
By computation and mine host's report.
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

Beating him

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
a wherefore.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Thank me, sir, for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
In good time, sir; what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Basting.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
For two; and sound ones too.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, not sound, I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Sure ones, then.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Certain ones then.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Name them.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
The one, to save the money that he spends in
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
You would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
lost by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
to the world's end will have bald followers.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA 
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled that same drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
As strange unto your town as to your talk;
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Want wit in all one word to understand.

LUCIANA 
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
By Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
By me?

ADRIANA 
By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
What is the course and drift of your compact?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I never spake with her in all my life.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
How can she thus then call us by our names,
Unless it be by inspiration.

ADRIANA 
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

LUCIANA 
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

LUCIANA 
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I am transformed, master, am I not?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
ANTIPHOLUS
