Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
yet was not the knight forsworn.

CELIA 
How prove you that, in the great heap of your
knowledge?

ROSALIND 
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

TOUCHSTONE 
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA 
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE 
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

CELIA 
Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE 
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

CELIA 
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.

TOUCHSTONE 
The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly.

CELIA 
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.

ROSALIND 
With his mouth full of news.

CELIA 
Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.

ROSALIND 
Then shall we be news-crammed.

CELIA 
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.

Enter LE BEAU

Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?

LE BEAU 
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

CELIA 
Sport! of what colour?

LE BEAU 
What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND 
As wit and fortune will.

TOUCHSTONE 
Or as the Destinies decree.

CELIA 
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

TOUCHSTONE 
Nay, if I keep not my rank,--

ROSALIND 
Thou losest thy old smell.

LE BEAU 
You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

ROSALIND 
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.

LE BEAU 
I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
to perform it.

CELIA 
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

LE BEAU 
There comes an old man and his three sons,--

CELIA 
I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU 
Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND 
With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
by these presents.'

LE BEAU 
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
their father, making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

ROSALIND 
Alas!

TOUCHSTONE 
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
have lost?

LE BEAU 
Why, this that I speak of.

TOUCHSTONE 
Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies.

CELIA 
Or I, I promise thee.

ROSALIND 
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

LE BEAU 
You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
perform it.

CELIA 
Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants

DUKE FREDERICK 
Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
own peril on his forwardness.

ROSALIND 
Is yonder the man?

LE BEAU 
Even he, madam.

CELIA 
Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.

DUKE FREDERICK 
How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
to see the wrestling?

ROSALIND 
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.

DUKE FREDERICK 
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
you can move him.

CELIA 
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Do so: I'll not be by.

LE BEAU 
Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.

ORLANDO 
I attend them with all respect and duty.

ROSALIND 
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO 
No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
come but in, as others do, to try with him the
strength of my youth.

CELIA 
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

ROSALIND 
Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward.

ORLANDO 
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
the world I fill up a place, which may be better
supplied when I have made it empty.

ROSALIND 
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.

CELIA 
And mine, to eke out hers.

ROSALIND 
Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!

CELIA 
Your heart's desires be with you!

CHARLES 
Come, where is this young gallant that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth?

ORLANDO 
Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.

DUKE FREDERICK 
You shall try but one fall.

CHARLES 
No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first.

ORLANDO 
An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
mocked me before: but come your ways.

ROSALIND 
Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

CELIA 
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
fellow by the leg.

They wrestle

ROSALIND 
O excellent young man!

CELIA 
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
should down.

Shout. CHARLES is thrown

DUKE FREDERICK 
No more, no more.

ORLANDO 
Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.

DUKE FREDERICK 
How dost thou, Charles?

LE BEAU 
He cannot speak, my lord.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?

ORLANDO 
Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

DUKE FREDERICK 
I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
But I did find him still mine enemy:
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.

Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU

CELIA 
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

ORLANDO 
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
To be adopted heir to Frederick.

ROSALIND 
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
And all the world was of my father's mind:
Had I before known this young man his son,
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
Ere he should thus have ventured.

CELIA 
Gentle cousin,
Let us go thank him and encourage him:
My father's rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
Your mistress shall be happy.

ROSALIND 
Gentleman,

Giving him a chain from her neck

Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
Shall we go, coz?

CELIA 
Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.

ORLANDO 
Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

ROSALIND 
He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies.

CELIA 
Will you go, coz?

ROSALIND 
Have with you. Fare you well.

Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

ORLANDO 
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.

Re-enter LE BEAU

LE BEAU 
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation, true applause and love,
Yet such is now the duke's condition
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.

ORLANDO 
I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU 
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
To keep his daughter company; whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this duke
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

ORLANDO 
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

Exit LE BEAU

Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
But heavenly Rosalind!

Exit

SCENE III. A room in the palace.

Enter CELIA and ROSALIND 
CELIA 
Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?

ROSALIND 
Not one to throw at a dog.

CELIA 
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.

ROSALIND 
Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any.

CELIA 
But is all this for your father?

ROSALIND 
No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
full of briers is this working-day world!

CELIA 
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them.

ROSALIND 
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.

CELIA 
Hem them away.

ROSALIND 
I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.

CELIA 
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

ROSALIND 
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!

CELIA 
O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

ROSALIND 
The duke my father loved his father dearly.

CELIA 
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
not Orlando.

ROSALIND 
No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

CELIA 
Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?

ROSALIND 
Let me love him for that, and do you love him
because I do. Look, here comes the duke.

CELIA 
With his eyes full of anger.

Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK 
Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
And get you from our court.

ROSALIND 
Me, uncle?

DUKE FREDERICK 
You, cousin
Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
So near our public court as twenty miles,
Thou diest for it.

ROSALIND 
I do beseech your grace,
Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
If with myself I hold intelligence
Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
Never so much as in a thought unborn
Did I offend your highness.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Thus do all traitors:
If their purgation did consist in words,
They are as innocent as grace itself:
Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

ROSALIND 
Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.

ROSALIND 
So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
So was I when your highness banish'd him:
Treason is not inherited, my lord;
Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
To think my poverty is treacherous.

CELIA 
Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA 
I did not then entreat to have her stay;
It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
I was too young that time to value her;
But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
Why so am I; we still have slept together,
Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
Still we went coupled and inseparable.

DUKE FREDERICK 
She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
Her very silence and her patience
Speak to the people, and they pity her.
Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
Firm and irrevocable is my doom
Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.

CELIA 
Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
I cannot live out of her company.

DUKE FREDERICK 
You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
And in the greatness of my word, you die.

Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords

CELIA 
O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

ROSALIND 
I have more cause.

CELIA 
Thou hast not, cousin;
Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

ROSALIND 
That he hath not.

CELIA 
No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
No: let my father seek another heir.
Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
Whither to go and what to bear with us;
And do not seek to take your change upon you,
To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

ROSALIND 
Why, whither shall we go?

CELIA 
To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

ROSALIND 
Alas, what danger will it be to us,
Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

CELIA 
I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
The like do you: so shall we pass along
And never stir assailants.

ROSALIND 
Were it not better,
Because that I am more than common tall,
That I did suit me all points like a man?
A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
As many other mannish cowards have
That do outface it with their semblances.

CELIA 
What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

ROSALIND 
I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
But what will you be call'd?

CELIA 
Something that hath a reference to my state
No longer Celia, but Aliena.

ROSALIND 
But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
The clownish fool out of your father's court?
Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

CELIA 
He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
And get our jewels and our wealth together,
Devise the fittest time and safest way
To hide us from pursuit that will be made
After my flight. Now go we in content
To liberty and not to banishment.

Exeunt


ACT II
SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.

Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters 
DUKE SENIOR 
Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life exempt from public haunt
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
I would not change it.

AMIENS 
Happy is your grace,
That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

DUKE SENIOR 
Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should in their own confines with forked heads
Have their round haunches gored.

First Lord 
Indeed, my lord,
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
Augmenting it with tears.

DUKE SENIOR 
But what said Jaques?
Did he not moralize this spectacle?

First Lord 
O, yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
