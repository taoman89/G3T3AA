
KING LEAR 
What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
Within a fortnight!

ALBANY 
What's the matter, sir?

KING LEAR 
I'll tell thee:

To GONERIL

Life and death! I am ashamed
That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
The untented woundings of a father's curse
Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
I warrant thee.

Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants

GONERIL 
Do you mark that, my lord?

ALBANY 
I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
To the great love I bear you,--

GONERIL 
Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!

To the Fool

You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

Fool 
Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
with thee.
A fox, when one has caught her,
And such a daughter,
Should sure to the slaughter,
If my cap would buy a halter:
So the fool follows after.

Exit

GONERIL 
This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!

ALBANY 
Well, you may fear too far.

GONERIL 
Safer than trust too far:
Let me still take away the harms I fear,
Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
If she sustain him and his hundred knights
When I have show'd the unfitness,--

Re-enter OSWALD

How now, Oswald!
What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

OSWALD 
Yes, madam.

GONERIL 
Take you some company, and away to horse:
Inform her full of my particular fear;
And thereto add such reasons of your own
As may compact it more. Get you gone;
And hasten your return.

Exit OSWALD

No, no, my lord,
This milky gentleness and course of yours
Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
Than praised for harmful mildness.

ALBANY 
How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

GONERIL 
Nay, then--

ALBANY 
Well, well; the event.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Court before the same.

Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool 
KING LEAR 
Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.

KENT 
I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
your letter.

Exit

Fool 
If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
danger of kibes?

KING LEAR 
Ay, boy.

Fool 
Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
slip-shod.

KING LEAR 
Ha, ha, ha!

Fool 
Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.

KING LEAR 
Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?

Fool 
She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
the middle on's face?

KING LEAR 
No.

Fool 
Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.

KING LEAR 
I did her wrong--

Fool 
Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

KING LEAR 
No.

Fool 
Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

KING LEAR 
Why?

Fool 
Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
daughters, and leave his horns without a case.

KING LEAR 
I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
horses ready?

Fool 
Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.

KING LEAR 
Because they are not eight?

Fool 
Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.

KING LEAR 
To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

Fool 
If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
for being old before thy time.

KING LEAR 
How's that?

Fool 
Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
been wise.

KING LEAR 
O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!

Enter Gentleman

How now! are the horses ready?

Gentleman 
Ready, my lord.

KING LEAR 
Come, boy.

Fool 
She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.

Exeunt


ACT II
SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.

Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him 
EDMUND 
Save thee, Curan.

CURAN 
And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
his duchess will be here with him this night.

EDMUND 
How comes that?

CURAN 
Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
ear-kissing arguments?

EDMUND 
Not I pray you, what are they?

CURAN 
Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

EDMUND 
Not a word.

CURAN 
You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.

Exit

EDMUND 
The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
This weaves itself perforce into my business.
My father hath set guard to take my brother;
And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!

Enter EDGAR

My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
Intelligence is given where you are hid;
You have now the good advantage of the night:
Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
And Regan with him: have you nothing said
Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
Advise yourself.

EDGAR 
I am sure on't, not a word.

EDMUND 
I hear my father coming: pardon me:
In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.

Exit EDGAR

Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.

Wounds his arm

Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
Stop, stop! No help?

Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches

GLOUCESTER 
Now, Edmund, where's the villain?

EDMUND 
Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
To stand auspicious mistress,--

GLOUCESTER 
But where is he?

EDMUND 
Look, sir, I bleed.

GLOUCESTER 
Where is the villain, Edmund?

EDMUND 
Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--

GLOUCESTER 
Pursue him, ho! Go after.

Exeunt some Servants

By no means what?

EDMUND 
Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
But that I told him, the revenging gods
'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
With his prepared sword, he charges home
My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
Full suddenly he fled.

GLOUCESTER 
Let him fly far:
Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
By his authority I will proclaim it,
That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
He that conceals him, death.

EDMUND 
When I dissuaded him from his intent,
And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
My very character,--I'ld turn it all
To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
And thou must make a dullard of the world,
If they not thought the profits of my death
Were very pregnant and potential spurs
To make thee seek it.'

GLOUCESTER 
Strong and fasten'd villain
Would he deny his letter? I never got him.

Tucket within

Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
May have the due note of him; and of my land,
Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
To make thee capable.

Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants

CORNWALL 
How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.

REGAN 
If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?

GLOUCESTER 
O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!

REGAN 
What, did my father's godson seek your life?
He whom my father named? your Edgar?

GLOUCESTER 
O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

REGAN 
Was he not companion with the riotous knights
That tend upon my father?

GLOUCESTER 
I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.

EDMUND 
Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

REGAN 
No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
I have this present evening from my sister
Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
That if they come to sojourn at my house,
I'll not be there.

CORNWALL 
Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
A child-like office.

EDMUND 
'Twas my duty, sir.

GLOUCESTER 
He did bewray his practise; and received
This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

CORNWALL 
Is he pursued?

GLOUCESTER 
Ay, my good lord.

CORNWALL 
If he be taken, he shall never more
Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
You we first seize on.

EDMUND 
I shall serve you, sir,
Truly, however else.

GLOUCESTER 
For him I thank your grace.

CORNWALL 
You know not why we came to visit you,--

REGAN 
Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
Wherein we must have use of your advice:
Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
Of differences, which I least thought it fit
To answer from our home; the several messengers
From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
Your needful counsel to our business,
Which craves the instant use.

GLOUCESTER 
I serve you, madam:
Your graces are right welcome.

Exeunt

SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.

Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally 
OSWALD 
Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?

KENT 
Ay.

OSWALD 
Where may we set our horses?

KENT 
I' the mire.

OSWALD 
Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.

KENT 
I love thee not.

OSWALD 
Why, then, I care not for thee.

KENT 
If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
care for me.

OSWALD 
Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

KENT 
Fellow, I know thee.

OSWALD 
What dost thou know me for?

KENT 
A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
the least syllable of thy addition.

The Tragedy of Macbeth

ACT I
SCENE I. A desert place.

Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches 
First Witch 
When shall we three meet again
In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch 
When the hurlyburly's done,
When the battle's lost and won.

Third Witch 
That will be ere the set of sun.

First Witch 
Where the place?

Second Witch 
Upon the heath.

Third Witch 
There to meet with Macbeth.

First Witch 
I come, Graymalkin!

Second Witch 
Paddock calls.

Third Witch 
Anon.

ALL 
Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
Hover through the fog and filthy air.

Exeunt

SCENE II. A camp near Forres.

Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant 
DUNCAN 
What bloody man is that? He can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.

MALCOLM 
This is the sergeant
Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.

Sergeant 
Doubtful it stood;
As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
The multiplying villanies of nature
Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valour's minion carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN 
O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

Sergeant 
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN 
Dismay'd not this
Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

Sergeant 
Yes;
As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
If I say sooth, I must report they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
Or memorise another Golgotha,
I cannot tell.
But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN 
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.

Exit Sergeant, attended

Who comes here?

Enter ROSS

MALCOLM 
The worthy thane of Ross.

LENNOX 
What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS 
God save the king!

DUNCAN 
Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

ROSS 
From Fife, great king;
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
With terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN 
Great happiness!

ROSS 
That now
Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN 
No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS 
I'll see it done.

DUNCAN 
What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

Exeunt

SCENE III. A heath near Forres.

Thunder. Enter the three Witches 
First Witch 
Where hast thou been, sister?

Second Witch 
Killing swine.

Third Witch 
Sister, where thou?

First Witch 
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
'Give me,' quoth I:
'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
And, like a rat without a tail,
I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

Second Witch 
I'll give thee a wind.

First Witch 
Thou'rt kind.

Third Witch 
And I another.

First Witch 
I myself have all the other,
And the very ports they blow,
All the quarters that they know
I' the shipman's card.
I will drain him dry as hay:
