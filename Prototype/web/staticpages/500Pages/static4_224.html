
KING 
I'll fee thee to stand up.

LAFEU 
Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

KING 
I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
And ask'd thee mercy for't.

LAFEU 
Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
Will you be cured of your infirmity?

KING 
No.

LAFEU 
O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
And write to her a love-line.

KING 
What 'her' is this?

LAFEU 
Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
For that is her demand, and know her business?
That done, laugh well at me.

KING 
Now, good Lafeu,
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
By wondering how thou took'st it.

LAFEU 
Nay, I'll fit you,
And not be all day neither.

Exit

KING 
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA

LAFEU 
Nay, come your ways.

KING 
This haste hath wings indeed.

LAFEU 
Nay, come your ways:
This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
That dare leave two together; fare you well.

Exit

KING 
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

HELENA 
Ay, my good lord.
Gerard de Narbon was my father;
In what he did profess, well found.

KING 
I knew him.

HELENA 
The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
And of his old experience the oily darling,
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
I come to tender it and my appliance
With all bound humbleness.

KING 
We thank you, maiden;
But may not be so credulous of cure,
When our most learned doctors leave us and
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
To prostitute our past-cure malady
To empirics, or to dissever so
Our great self and our credit, to esteem
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

HELENA 
My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
I will no more enforce mine office on you.
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one, to bear me back a again.

KING 
I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
As one near death to those that wish him live:
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

HELENA 
What I can do can do no hurt to try,
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister:
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
From simple sources, and great seas have dried
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Where most it promises, and oft it hits
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

KING 
I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

HELENA 
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
It is not so with Him that all things knows
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an impostor that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim;
But know I think and think I know most sure
My art is not past power nor you past cure.

KING 
Are thou so confident? within what space
Hopest thou my cure?

HELENA 
The great'st grace lending grace
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

KING 
Upon thy certainty and confidence
What darest thou venture?

HELENA 
Tax of impudence,
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
With vilest torture let my life be ended.

KING 
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak:
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense, sense saves another way.
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
That happiness and prime can happy call:
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
That ministers thine own death if I die.

HELENA 
If I break time, or flinch in property
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
But, if I help, what do you promise me?

KING 
Make thy demand.

HELENA 
But will you make it even?

KING 
Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

HELENA 
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command:
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

KING 
Here is my hand; the premises observed,
Thy will by my performance shall be served:
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
More should I question thee, and more I must,
Though more to know could not be more to trust,
From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS and Clown 
COUNTESS 
Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
your breeding.

Clown 
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
know my business is but to the court.

COUNTESS 
To the court! why, what place make you special,
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

Clown 
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
men.

COUNTESS 
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
questions.

Clown 
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
buttock, or any buttock.

COUNTESS 
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

Clown 
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

COUNTESS 
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
questions?

Clown 
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
will fit any question.

COUNTESS 
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
must fit all demands.

Clown 
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
do you no harm to learn.

COUNTESS 
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

Clown 
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
more, a hundred of them.

COUNTESS 
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

COUNTESS 
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

COUNTESS 
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! spare not me.

COUNTESS 
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

Clown 
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

COUNTESS 
I play the noble housewife with the time
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

COUNTESS 
An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
And urge her to a present answer back:
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
This is not much.

Clown 
Not much commendation to them.

COUNTESS 
Not much employment for you: you understand me?

Clown 
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

COUNTESS 
Haste you again.

Exeunt severally

SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.

Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES 
LAFEU 
They say miracles are past; and we have our
philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear.

PAROLLES 
Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
shot out in our latter times.

BERTRAM 
And so 'tis.

LAFEU 
To be relinquish'd of the artists,--

PAROLLES 
So I say.

LAFEU 
Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

PAROLLES 
So I say.

LAFEU 
Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--

PAROLLES 
Right; so I say.

LAFEU 
That gave him out incurable,--

PAROLLES 
Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

LAFEU 
Not to be helped,--

PAROLLES 
Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--

LAFEU 
Uncertain life, and sure death.

PAROLLES 
Just, you say well; so would I have said.

LAFEU 
I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

PAROLLES 
It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
shall read it in--what do you call there?

LAFEU 
A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

PAROLLES 
That's it; I would have said the very same.

LAFEU 
Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
I speak in respect--

PAROLLES 
Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--

LAFEU 
Very hand of heaven.

PAROLLES 
Ay, so I say.

LAFEU 
In a most weak--

pausing

and debile minister, great power, great
transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
further use to be made than alone the recovery of
the king, as to be--

pausing

generally thankful.

PAROLLES 
I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.

Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire

LAFEU 
Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
able to lead her a coranto.

PAROLLES 
Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?

LAFEU 
'Fore God, I think so.

KING 
Go, call before me all the lords in court.
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
The confirmation of my promised gift,
Which but attends thy naming.

Enter three or four Lords

Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
I have to use: thy frank election make;
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

HELENA 
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

LAFEU 
I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
And writ as little beard.

KING 
Peruse them well:
Not one of those but had a noble father.

HELENA 
Gentlemen,
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.

All 
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

HELENA 
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
That I protest I simply am a maid.
Please it your majesty, I have done already:
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
We'll ne'er come there again.'

KING 
Make choice; and, see,
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

HELENA 
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

First Lord 
And grant it.

HELENA 
Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

LAFEU 
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
for my life.

HELENA 
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes and her humble love!

Second Lord 
No better, if you please.

HELENA 
My wish receive,
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

LAFEU 
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
Turk, to make eunuchs of.

HELENA 
Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

LAFEU 
These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
ne'er got 'em.

HELENA 
You are too young, too happy, and too good,
To make yourself a son out of my blood.

Fourth Lord 
Fair one, I think not so.

LAFEU 
There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
of fourteen; I have known thee already.

HELENA 
[To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
Into your guiding power. This is the man.

KING 
Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

BERTRAM 
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.

KING 
Know'st thou not, Bertram,
What she has done for me?

BERTRAM 
Yes, my good lord;
But never hope to know why I should marry her.

KING 
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.

BERTRAM 
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
She had her breeding at my father's charge.
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever!

KING 
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
In differences so mighty. If she be
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
The property by what it is should go,
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
In these to nature she's immediate heir,
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
Which challenges itself as honour's born
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
When rather from our acts we them derive
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
I can create the rest: virtue and she
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

BERTRAM 
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

KING 
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

HELENA 
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
Let the rest go.

KING 
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
We, poising us in her defective scale,
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
Believe not thy disdain, but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

BERTRAM 
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
Is as 'twere born so.

KING 
Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.

BERTRAM 
I take her hand.

KING 
Good fortune and the favour of the king
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES

LAFEU 
[Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.

PAROLLES 
Your pleasure, sir?

LAFEU 
Your lord and master did well to make his
recantation.

PAROLLES 
Recantation! My lord! my master!

LAFEU 
Ay; is it not a language I speak?

PAROLLES 
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
bloody succeeding. My master!

LAFEU 
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

PAROLLES 
To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

LAFEU 
To what is count's man: count's master is of
another style.
