We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS 
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.

MENAS 
You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

MENAS 
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS 
Pray ye, sir?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
'Tis true.

MENAS 
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
not prophesy so.

MENAS 
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS 
Who would not have his wife so?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.

MENAS 
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
I have a health for you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.

MENAS 
Come, let's away.

Exeunt

SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.

Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet 
First Servant 
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
will blow them down.

Second Servant 
Lepidus is high-coloured.

First Servant 
They have made him drink alms-drink.

Second Servant 
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
entreaty, and himself to the drink.

First Servant 
But it raises the greater war between him and
his discretion.

Second Servant 
Why, this is to have a name in great men's
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.

First Servant 
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains

MARK ANTONY 
[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS 
You've strange serpents there.

MARK ANTONY 
Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS 
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.

MARK ANTONY 
They are so.

POMPEY 
Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS 
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

LEPIDUS 
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
pyramises are very goodly things; without
contradiction, I have heard that.

MENAS 
[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
what is't?

MENAS 
[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
thee, captain,
And hear me speak a word.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
This wine for Lepidus!

LEPIDUS 
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

MARK ANTONY 
It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
it, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS 
What colour is it of?

MARK ANTONY 
Of it own colour too.

LEPIDUS 
'Tis a strange serpent.

MARK ANTONY 
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Will this description satisfy him?

MARK ANTONY 
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
very epicure.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
that? away!
Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?

MENAS 
[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
wilt hear me,
Rise from thy stool.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
The matter?

Rises, and walks aside

MENAS 
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

POMPEY 
Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
Be jolly, lords.

MARK ANTONY 
These quick-sands, Lepidus,
Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS 
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY 
What say'st thou?

MENAS 
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY 
How should that be?

MENAS 
But entertain it,
And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY 
Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS 
Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY 
Show me which way.

MENAS 
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
All there is thine.

POMPEY 
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done;
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS 
[Aside] For this,
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
Shall never find it more.

POMPEY 
This health to Lepidus!

MARK ANTONY 
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS 
Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY 
Fill till the cup be hid.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS

MENAS 
Why?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
not?

MENAS 
The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
That it might go on wheels!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS 
Come.

POMPEY 
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

MARK ANTONY 
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
Here is to Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
And it grows fouler.

MARK ANTONY 
Be a child o' the time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Possess it, I'll make answer:
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ha, my brave emperor!

To MARK ANTONY

Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY 
Let's ha't, good soldier.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, let's all take hands,
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.

Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand

THE SONG.
Come, thou monarch of the vine,
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
Cup us, till the world go round,
Cup us, till the world go round!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
Let me request you off: our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY 
I'll try you on the shore.

MARK ANTONY 
And shall, sir; give's your hand.

POMPEY 
O Antony,
You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
Come, down into the boat.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Take heed you fall not.

Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS

Menas, I'll not on shore.

MENAS 
No, to my cabin.
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!

Sound a flourish, with drums

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ho! says a' There's my cap.

MENAS 
Ho! Noble captain, come.

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.

Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him 
VENTIDIUS 
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS 
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS 
O Silius, Silius,
I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
Better to leave undone, than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person: Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.

SILIUS 
Thou hast, Ventidius,
that
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!

VENTIDIUS 
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' the field.

SILIUS 
Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS 
He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with's will permit,
We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!

Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another 
AGRIPPA 
What, are the brothers parted?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA 
'Tis a noble Lepidus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA 
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA 
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

AGRIPPA 
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.

AGRIPPA 
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA 
Both he loves.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
They are his shards, and he their beetle.

Trumpets within

So;
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA 
Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY 
No further, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.

MARK ANTONY 
Make me not offended
In your distrust.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I have said.

MARK ANTONY 
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
The elements be kind to thee, and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.

OCTAVIA 
My noble brother!

MARK ANTONY 
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

OCTAVIA 
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA 
I'll tell you in your ear.

MARK ANTONY 
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
down-feather,
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
And neither way inclines.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't, till I wept too.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Adieu; be happy!

LEPIDUS 
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Farewell, fa rewell!

Kisses OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY 
Farewell!

Trumpets sound. Exeunt

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS 
CLEOPATRA 
Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS 
Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA 
Go to, go to.

Enter the Messenger as before

Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS 
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.

CLEOPATRA 
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

Messenger 
Most gracious majesty,--

CLEOPATRA 
Didst thou behold Octavia?

Messenger 
Ay, dread queen.

CLEOPATRA 
Where?

Messenger 
Madam, in Rome;
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA 
Is she as tall as me?

Messenger 
She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

Messenger 
Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.

CLEOPATRA 
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN 
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA 
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

Messenger 
She creeps:
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA 
Is this certain?

Messenger 
Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN 
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA 
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN 
Excellent.

CLEOPATRA 
Guess at her years, I prithee.

Messenger 
Madam,
She was a widow,--

CLEOPATRA
