I never gave you aught.

OPHELIA 
My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
Take these again; for to the noble mind
Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
There, my lord.

HAMLET 
Ha, ha! are you honest?

OPHELIA 
My lord?

HAMLET 
Are you fair?

OPHELIA 
What means your lordship?

HAMLET 
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
admit no discourse to your beauty.

OPHELIA 
Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
with honesty?

HAMLET 
Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
force of honesty can translate beauty into his
likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
time gives it proof. I did love you once.

OPHELIA 
Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

HAMLET 
You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
it: I loved you not.

OPHELIA 
I was the more deceived.

HAMLET 
Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
Where's your father?

OPHELIA 
At home, my lord.

HAMLET 
Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.

OPHELIA 
O, help him, you sweet heavens!

HAMLET 
If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
and quickly too. Farewell.

OPHELIA 
O heavenly powers, restore him!

HAMLET 
I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
has given you one face, and you make yourselves
another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
those that are married already, all but one, shall
live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
nunnery, go.

Exit

OPHELIA 
O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

KING CLAUDIUS 
Love! his affections do not that way tend;
Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
I have in quick determination
Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
For the demand of our neglected tribute
Haply the seas and countries different
With variable objects shall expel
This something-settled matter in his heart,
Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

LORD POLONIUS 
It shall do well: but yet do I believe
The origin and commencement of his grief
Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
But, if you hold it fit, after the play
Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
To show his grief: let her be round with him;
And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
Of all their conference. If she find him not,
To England send him, or confine him where
Your wisdom best shall think.

KING CLAUDIUS 
It shall be so:
Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

Enter HAMLET and Players 
HAMLET 
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
for the most part are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

First Player 
I warrant your honour.

HAMLET 
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
censure of the which one must in your allowance
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
players that I have seen play, and heard others
praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

First Player 
I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
sir.

HAMLET 
O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
question of the play be then to be considered:
that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

Exeunt Players

Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?

LORD POLONIUS 
And the queen too, and that presently.

HAMLET 
Bid the players make haste.

Exit POLONIUS

Will you two help to hasten them?

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN 
We will, my lord.

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

HAMLET 
What ho! Horatio!

Enter HORATIO

HORATIO 
Here, sweet lord, at your service.

HAMLET 
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
As e'er my conversation coped withal.

HORATIO 
O, my dear lord,--

HAMLET 
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee
That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
There is a play to-night before the king;
One scene of it comes near the circumstance
Which I have told thee of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And after we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.

HORATIO 
Well, my lord:
If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

HAMLET 
They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
Get you a place.

Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

KING CLAUDIUS 
How fares our cousin Hamlet?

HAMLET 
Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

KING CLAUDIUS 
I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
are not mine.

HAMLET 
No, nor mine now.

To POLONIUS

My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

LORD POLONIUS 
That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

HAMLET 
What did you enact?

LORD POLONIUS 
I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
Capitol; Brutus killed me.

HAMLET 
It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
there. Be the players ready?

ROSENCRANTZ 
Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

HAMLET 
No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

LORD POLONIUS 
[To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?

HAMLET 
Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

Lying down at OPHELIA's feet

OPHELIA 
No, my lord.

HAMLET 
I mean, my head upon your lap?

OPHELIA 
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET 
Do you think I meant country matters?

OPHELIA 
I think nothing, my lord.

HAMLET 
That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

OPHELIA 
What is, my lord?

HAMLET 
Nothing.

OPHELIA 
You are merry, my lord.

HAMLET 
Who, I?

OPHELIA 
Ay, my lord.

HAMLET 
O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.

OPHELIA 
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET 
So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
the hobby-horse is forgot.'

Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters

Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

Exeunt

OPHELIA 
What means this, my lord?

HAMLET 
Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA 
Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

Enter Prologue

HAMLET 
We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
keep counsel; they'll tell all.

OPHELIA 
Will he tell us what this show meant?

HAMLET 
Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

OPHELIA 
You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.

Prologue 
For us, and for our tragedy,
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.

Exit

HAMLET 
Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?

OPHELIA 
'Tis brief, my lord.

HAMLET 
As woman's love.

Enter two Players, King and Queen

Player King 
Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
About the world have times twelve thirties been,
Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
Unite commutual in most sacred bands.

Player Queen 
So many journeys may the sun and moon
Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
So far from cheer and from your former state,
That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
For women's fear and love holds quantity;
In neither aught, or in extremity.
Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

Player King 
'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
My operant powers their functions leave to do:
And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
For husband shalt thou--

Player Queen 
O, confound the rest!
Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
In second husband let me be accurst!
None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

HAMLET 
[Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.

Player Queen 
The instances that second marriage move
Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
A second time I kill my husband dead,
When second husband kisses me in bed.

Player King 
I do believe you think what now you speak;
But what we do determine oft we break.
Purpose is but the slave to memory,
Of violent birth, but poor validity;
Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
Most necessary 'tis that we forget
To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
What to ourselves in passion we propose,
The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
The violence of either grief or joy
Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
Directly seasons him his enemy.
But, orderly to end where I begun,
Our wills and fates do so contrary run
That our devices still are overthrown;
Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

Player Queen 
Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
To desperation turn my trust and hope!
An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

HAMLET 
If she should break it now!

Player King 
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
The tedious day with sleep.

Sleeps

Player Queen 
Sleep rock thy brain,
And never come mischance between us twain!

Exit

HAMLET 
Madam, how like you this play?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
The lady protests too much, methinks.

HAMLET 
O, but she'll keep her word.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?

HAMLET 
No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
i' the world.

KING CLAUDIUS 
What do you call the play?

HAMLET 
The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
withers are unwrung.

Enter LUCIANUS

This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

OPHELIA 
You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

HAMLET 
I could interpret between you and your love, if I
could see the puppets dallying.

OPHELIA 
You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

HAMLET 
It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

OPHELIA 
Still better, and worse.

HAMLET 
So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'

LUCIANUS 
Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
Thy natural magic and dire property,
On wholesome life usurp immediately.

Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears

HAMLET 
He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

OPHELIA 
The king rises.

HAMLET 
What, frighted with false fire!

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
How fares my lord?

LORD POLONIUS 
Give o'er the play.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Give me some light: away!

All 
Lights, lights, lights!

Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET 
Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
The hart ungalled play;
For some must watch, while some must sleep:
So runs the world away.
Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

HORATIO 
Half a share.

HAMLET 
A whole one, I.
For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
This realm dismantled was
Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
A very, very--pajock.

HORATIO 
You might have rhymed.

HAMLET 
O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
thousand pound. Didst perceive?

HORATIO 
Very well, my lord.

HAMLET 
Upon the talk of the poisoning?

HORATIO 
I did very well note him.

HAMLET 
Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
For if the king like not the comedy,
Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
Come, some music!

Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

GUILDENSTERN 
Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

HAMLET 
Sir, a whole history.

GUILDENSTERN 
The king, sir,--

HAMLET 
Ay, sir, what of him?

GUILDENSTERN 
Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

HAMLET 
With drink, sir?

GUILDENSTERN 
No, my lord, rather with choler.

HAMLET 
Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
more choler.

GUILDENSTERN 
Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
start not so wildly from my affair.

HAMLET 
I am tame, sir: pronounce.

GUILDENSTERN 
The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
spirit, hath sent me to you.

HAMLET 
You are welcome.

GUILDENSTERN 
Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
breed. If it shall please you to make me a
wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.

HAMLET 
Sir, I cannot.

GUILDENSTERN 
What, my lord?

HAMLET 
Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--

ROSENCRANTZ 
Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.

HAMLET 
O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
admiration? Impart.

ROSENCRANTZ 
She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
go to bed.

HAMLET 
We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
you any further trade with us?

ROSENCRANTZ 
My lord, you once did love me.

HAMLET 
So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

ROSENCRANTZ 
Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
you deny your griefs to your friend.

HAMLET 
Sir, I lack advancement.

ROSENCRANTZ 
How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?

HAMLET 
Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
is something musty.

Re-enter Players with recorders

O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
as if you would drive me into a toil?

GUILDENSTERN 
O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
unmannerly.

HAMLET 
I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
this pipe?

GUILDENSTERN 
My lord, I cannot.

HAMLET 
I pray you.

GUILDENSTERN 
Believe me, I cannot.

HAMLET 
I do beseech you.

GUILDENSTERN 
I know no touch of it, my lord.

HAMLET 
'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
Look you, these are the stops.

GUILDENSTERN 
But these cannot I command to any utterance of
harmony; I have not the skill.

HAMLET 
Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
the top of my compass: and there is much music,
excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
cannot play upon me.

Enter POLONIUS

God bless you, sir!

LORD POLONIUS 
My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
presently.

HAMLET 
Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

LORD POLONIUS 
By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

HAMLET 
Methinks it is like a weasel.

LORD POLONIUS 
It is backed like a weasel.

HAMLET 
Or like a whale?

LORD POLONIUS 
Very like a whale.

HAMLET 
Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.

LORD POLONIUS 
I will say so.

HAMLET 
By and by is easily said.

Exit POLONIUS

Leave me, friends.

Exeunt all but HAMLET

Tis now the very witching time of night,
When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
And do such bitter business as the day
Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
How in my words soever she be shent,
To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

Exit

SCENE III. A room in the castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS 
I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
And he to England shall along with you:
The terms of our estate may not endure
Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
Out of his lunacies.

GUILDENSTERN 
We will ourselves provide:
Most holy and religious fear it is
To keep those many many bodies safe
That live and feed upon your majesty.

ROSENCRANTZ 
The single and peculiar life is bound,
With all the strength and armour of the mind,
To keep itself from noyance; but much more
That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
The lives of many. The cease of majesty
Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
Each small annexment, petty consequence,
Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
For we will fetters put upon this fear,
Which now goes too free-footed.

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN 
We will haste us.

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS 
My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
And tell you what I know.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Thanks, dear my lord.

Exit POLONIUS

O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
But to confront the visage of offence?
And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,
My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
In the corrupted currents of this world
Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
All may be well.

Retires and kneels

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET 
Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
A villain kills my father; and for that,
I, his sole son, do this same villain send
To heaven.
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
He took my father grossly, full of bread;
With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
But in our circumstance and course of thought,
'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
To take him in the purging of his soul,
When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
No!
Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
At gaming, swearing, or about some act
That has no relish of salvation in't;
Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

Exit

KING CLAUDIUS 
[Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

Exit

SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.

Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS 
LORD POLONIUS 
He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.

HAMLET 
[Within] Mother, mother, mother!

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
I'll warrant you,
Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

POLONIUS hides behind the arras

Enter HAMLET

HAMLET 
Now, mother, what's the matter?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

HAMLET 
Mother, you have my father much offended.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

HAMLET 
Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Why, how now, Hamlet!

HAMLET 
What's the matter now?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Have you forgot me?

HAMLET 
No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

HAMLET 
Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
You go not till I set you up a glass
Where you may see the inmost part of you.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
Help, help, ho!

LORD POLONIUS 
[Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

HAMLET 
[Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

Makes a pass through the arras

LORD POLONIUS 
[Behind] O, I am slain!

Falls and dies

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O me, what hast thou done?

HAMLET 
Nay, I know not:
Is it the king?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

HAMLET 
A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
As kill a king!

HAMLET 
Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS

Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
If it be made of penetrable stuff,
If damned custom have not brass'd it so
That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
In noise so rude against me?

HAMLET 
Such an act
That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
From the fair forehead of an innocent love
And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
As from the body of contraction plucks
The very soul, and sweet religion makes
A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
With tristful visage, as against the doom,
Is thought-sick at the act.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Ay me, what act,
That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

HAMLET 
Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
A station like the herald Mercury
New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
A combination and a form indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of a man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
You cannot call it love; for at your age
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
But it reserved some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn
And reason panders will.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O Hamlet, speak no more:
Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
And there I see such black and grained spots
As will not leave their tinct.

HAMLET 
Nay, but to live
In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
Over the nasty sty,--

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O, speak to me no more;
These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
No more, sweet Hamlet!

HAMLET 
A murderer and a villain;
A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
And put it in his pocket!

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
No more!

HAMLET 
A king of shreds and patches,--

Enter Ghost

Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alas, he's mad!

HAMLET 
Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
The important acting of your dread command? O, say!

Ghost 
Do not forget: this visitation
Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
O, step between her and her fighting soul:
Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
Speak to her, Hamlet.

HAMLET 
How is it with you, lady?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alas, how is't with you,
That you do bend your eye on vacancy
And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

HAMLET 
On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
Lest with this piteous action you convert
My stern effects: then what I have to do
Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
To whom do you speak this?

HAMLET 
Do you see nothing there?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

HAMLET 
Nor did you nothing hear?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
No, nothing but ourselves.

HAMLET 
Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!
Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

Exit Ghost

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
This the very coinage of your brain:
This bodiless creation ecstasy
Is very cunning in.

HAMLET 
Ecstasy!
My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
And I the matter will re-word; which madness
Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
For in the fatness of these pursy times
Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

HAMLET 
O, throw away the worser part of it,
And live the purer with the other half.
Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
That to the use of actions fair and good
He likewise gives a frock or livery,
That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
And that shall lend a kind of easiness
To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,

Pointing to POLONIUS

I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
To punish me with this and this with me,
That I must be their scourge and minister.
I will bestow him, and will answer well
The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
I must be cruel, only to be kind:
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
One word more, good lady.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
What shall I do?

HAMLET 
Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
Make you to ravel all this matter out,
That I essentially am not in madness,
But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
And break your own neck down.

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
What thou hast said to me.

HAMLET 
I must to England; you know that?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Alack,
I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

HAMLET 
There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
But I will delve one yard below their mines,
And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
When in one line two crafts directly meet.
This man shall set me packing:
I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
Good night, mother.

Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS


ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN 
KING CLAUDIUS 
There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
Where is your son?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Bestow this place on us a little while.

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!

KING CLAUDIUS 
What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
Behind the arras hearing something stir,
Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
The unseen good old man.

KING CLAUDIUS 
O heavy deed!
It had been so with us, had we been there:
His liberty is full of threats to all;
To you yourself, to us, to every one.
Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
It will be laid to us, whose providence
Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
This mad young man: but so much was our love,
We would not understand what was most fit;
But, like the owner of a foul disease,
To keep it from divulging, let it feed
Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?

QUEEN GERTRUDE 
To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
Among a mineral of metals base,
Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

KING CLAUDIUS 
O Gertrude, come away!
The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
We must, with all our majesty and skill,
Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
And let them know, both what we mean to do,
And what's untimely done. O, come away!
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the castle.

Enter HAMLET 
HAMLET 
Safely stowed.

ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN: 
[Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

HAMLET 
What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
O, here they come.

Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

ROSENCRANTZ 
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

HAMLET 
Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

ROSENCRANTZ 
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
And bear it to the chapel.

HAMLET 
Do not believe it.

ROSENCRANTZ 
Believe what?

HAMLET 
That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
replication should be made by the son of a king?

ROSENCRANTZ 
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

HAMLET 
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
shall be dry again.

ROSENCRANTZ 
I understand you not, my lord.

HAMLET 
I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
foolish ear.

ROSENCRANTZ 
My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
with us to the king.

HAMLET 
The body is with the king, but the king is not with
the body. The king is a thing--

GUILDENSTERN 
A thing, my lord!

HAMLET 
Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.

Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended 
KING CLAUDIUS 
I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
He's loved of the distracted multitude,
Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
This sudden sending him away must seem
Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
By desperate appliance are relieved,
Or not at all.

Enter ROSENCRANTZ

How now! what hath befall'n?

ROSENCRANTZ 
Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
We cannot get from him.

KING CLAUDIUS 
But where is he?

ROSENCRANTZ 
Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Bring him before us.

ROSENCRANTZ 
Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS 
Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

HAMLET 
At supper.

KING CLAUDIUS 
At supper! where?

HAMLET 
Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
that's the end.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Alas, alas!

HAMLET 
A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

KING CLAUDIUS 
What dost you mean by this?

HAMLET 
Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
progress through the guts of a beggar.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Where is Polonius?

HAMLET 
In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
find him not there, seek him i' the other place
yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
stairs into the lobby.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Go seek him there.

To some Attendants

HAMLET 
He will stay till ye come.

Exeunt Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS 
Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
The associates tend, and every thing is bent
For England.

HAMLET 
For England!

KING CLAUDIUS 
Ay, Hamlet.

HAMLET 
Good.

KING CLAUDIUS 
So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

HAMLET 
I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
England! Farewell, dear mother.

KING CLAUDIUS 
Thy loving father, Hamlet.

HAMLET 
My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

Exit

KING CLAUDIUS 
Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.

Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
By letters congruing to that effect,
The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

Exit

SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.

Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching 
PRINCE FORTINBRAS 
Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
Craves the conveyance of a promised march
Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
If that his majesty would aught with us,
We shall express our duty in his eye;
And let him know so.

Captain 
I will do't, my lord.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS 
Go softly on.

Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers

Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

HAMLET 
Good sir, whose powers are these?

Captain 
They are of Norway, sir.

HAMLET 
How purposed, sir, I pray you?

Captain 
Against some part of Poland.

HAMLET 
Who commands them, sir?

Captain 
The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.

HAMLET 
Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
Or for some frontier?

Captain 
Truly to speak, and with no addition,
We go to gain a little patch of ground
That hath in it no profit but the name.
To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

HAMLET 
Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

Captain 
Yes, it is already garrison'd.

HAMLET 
Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
Will not debate the question of this straw:
This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

ACT I
SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black 
COUNTESS 
In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

BERTRAM 
And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

LAFEU 
You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
than lack it where there is such abundance.

COUNTESS 
What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

LAFEU 
He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
finds no other advantage in the process but only the
losing of hope by time.

COUNTESS 
This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
far, would have made nature immortal, and death
should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
the death of the king's disease.

LAFEU 
How called you the man you speak of, madam?

COUNTESS 
He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

LAFEU 
He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
could be set up against mortality.

BERTRAM 
What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?

LAFEU 
A fistula, my lord.

BERTRAM 
I heard not of it before.

LAFEU 
I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

COUNTESS 
His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
her education promises; her dispositions she
inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
traitors too; in her they are the better for their
simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

LAFEU 
Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

COUNTESS 
'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
a sorrow than have it.

HELENA 
I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

LAFEU 
Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
excessive grief the enemy to the living.

COUNTESS 
If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
makes it soon mortal.

BERTRAM 
Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

LAFEU 
How understand we that?

COUNTESS 
Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
Advise him.

LAFEU 
He cannot want the best
That shall attend his love.

COUNTESS 
Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

Exit

BERTRAM 
[To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.

LAFEU 
Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
your father.

Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU

HELENA 
O, were that all! I think not on my father;
And these great tears grace his remembrance more
Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
I have forgot him: my imagination
Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
I am undone: there is no living, none,
If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
That I should love a bright particular star
And think to wed it, he is so above me:
In his bright radiance and collateral light
Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
The hind that would be mated by the lion
Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
To see him every hour; to sit and draw
His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
In our heart's table; heart too capable
Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

Enter PAROLLES

Aside

One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
And yet I know him a notorious liar,
Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

PAROLLES 
Save you, fair queen!

HELENA 
And you, monarch!

PAROLLES 
No.

HELENA 
And no.

PAROLLES 
Are you meditating on virginity?

HELENA 
Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
may we barricado it against him?

PAROLLES 
Keep him out.

HELENA 
But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
warlike resistance.

PAROLLES 
There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
undermine you and blow you up.

HELENA 
Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
virgins might blow up men?

PAROLLES 
Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
increase and there was never virgin got till
virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!

HELENA 
I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

PAROLLES 
There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
virginity murders itself and should be buried in
highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!

HELENA 
How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

PAROLLES 
Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
now. Your date is better in your pie and your
porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
your old virginity, is like one of our French
withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?

HELENA 
Not my virginity yet [ ]
There shall your master have a thousand loves,
A mother and a mistress and a friend,
A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
His humble ambition, proud humility,
His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
I know not what he shall. God send him well!
The court's a learning place, and he is one--

PAROLLES 
What one, i' faith?

HELENA 
That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

PAROLLES 
What's pity?

HELENA 
That wishing well had not a body in't,
Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
Might with effects of them follow our friends,
And show what we alone must think, which never
Return us thanks.

Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

Exit

PAROLLES 
Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
will think of thee at court.

HELENA 
Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

PAROLLES 
Under Mars, I.

HELENA 
I especially think, under Mars.

PAROLLES 
Why under Mars?

HELENA 
The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
be born under Mars.

PAROLLES 
When he was predominant.

HELENA 
When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

PAROLLES 
Why think you so?

HELENA 
You go so much backward when you fight.

PAROLLES 
That's for advantage.

HELENA 
So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
but the composition that your valour and fear makes
in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

PAROLLES 
I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

Exit

HELENA 
Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
What power is it which mounts my love so high,
That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
To join like likes and kiss like native things.
Impossible be strange attempts to those
That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
So show her merit, that did miss her love?
The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

Exit

SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants 
KING 
The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
Have fought with equal fortune and continue
A braving war.

First Lord 
So 'tis reported, sir.

KING 
Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
With caution that the Florentine will move us
For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
Prejudicates the business and would seem
To have us make denial.

First Lord 
His love and wisdom,
Approved so to your majesty, may plead
For amplest credence.

KING 
He hath arm'd our answer,
And Florence is denied before he comes:
Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
To stand on either part.

Second Lord 
It well may serve
A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
For breathing and exploit.

KING 
What's he comes here?

Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

First Lord 
It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
Young Bertram.

KING 
Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

BERTRAM 
My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

KING 
I would I had that corporal soundness now,
As when thy father and myself in friendship
First tried our soldiership! He did look far
Into the service of the time and was
Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
But on us both did haggish age steal on
And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
To talk of your good father. In his youth
He had the wit which I can well observe
To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
Exception bid him speak, and at this time
His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
He used as creatures of another place
And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
Making them proud of his humility,
In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
Might be a copy to these younger times;
Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
But goers backward.

BERTRAM 
His good remembrance, sir,
Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
So in approof lives not his epitaph
As in your royal speech.

KING 
Would I were with him! He would always say--
Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
This his good melancholy oft began,
On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
I after him do after him wish too,
Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
To give some labourers room.

Second Lord 
You are loved, sir:
They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

KING 
I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
Since the physician at your father's died?
He was much famed.

BERTRAM 
Some six months since, my lord.

KING 
If he were living, I would try him yet.
Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
With several applications; nature and sickness
Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
My son's no dearer.

BERTRAM 
Thank your majesty.

Exeunt. Flourish

SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown 
COUNTESS 
I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?

Steward 
Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
wish might be found in the calendar of my past
endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
ourselves we publish them.

COUNTESS 
What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
enough to make such knaveries yours.

Clown 
'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

COUNTESS 
Well, sir.

Clown 
No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
the woman and I will do as we may.

COUNTESS 
Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

Clown 
I do beg your good will in this case.

COUNTESS 
In what case?

Clown 
In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
heritage: and I think I shall never have the
blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
they say barnes are blessings.

COUNTESS 
Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

Clown 
My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.

COUNTESS 
Is this all your worship's reason?

Clown 
Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
are.

COUNTESS 
May the world know them?

Clown 
I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
that I may repent.

COUNTESS 
Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

Clown 
I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
friends for my wife's sake.

COUNTESS 
Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

Clown 
You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
horns together, like any deer i' the herd.

COUNTESS 
Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?

Clown 
A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
way:
For I the ballad will repeat,
Which men full true shall find;
Your marriage comes by destiny,
Your cuckoo sings by kind.

COUNTESS 
Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

Steward 
May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
you: of her I am to speak.

COUNTESS 
Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
Helen, I mean.

Clown 
Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
Fond done, done fond,
Was this King Priam's joy?
With that she sighed as she stood,
With that she sighed as she stood,
And gave this sentence then;
Among nine bad if one be good,
Among nine bad if one be good,
There's yet one good in ten.

COUNTESS 
What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.

Clown 
One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
might have a good woman born but one every blazing
star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
one.

COUNTESS 
You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

Clown 
That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.

Exit

COUNTESS 
Well, now.

Steward 
I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

COUNTESS 
Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
make title to as much love as she finds: there is
more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
her than she'll demand.

Steward 
Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
to herself her own words to her own ears; she
thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
god, that would not extend his might, only where
qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
you something to know it.

COUNTESS 
You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.

Exit Steward

Enter HELENA

Even so it was with me when I was young:
If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
By our remembrances of days foregone,
Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.

HELENA 
What is your pleasure, madam?

COUNTESS 
You know, Helen,
I am a mother to you.

HELENA 
Mine honourable mistress.

COUNTESS 
Nay, a mother:
Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
And put you in the catalogue of those
That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
Yet I express to you a mother's care:
God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
Why? that you are my daughter?

HELENA 
That I am not.

COUNTESS 
I say, I am your mother.

HELENA 
Pardon, madam;
The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
No note upon my parents, his all noble:
My master, my dear lord he is; and I
His servant live, and will his vassal die:
He must not be my brother.

COUNTESS 
Nor I your mother?

HELENA 
You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
I care no more for than I do for heaven,
So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?

COUNTESS 
Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
The mystery of your loneliness, and find
Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
You love my son; invention is ashamed,
Against the proclamation of thy passion,
To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
That in their kind they speak it: only sin
And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
Tell me truly.

HELENA 
Good madam, pardon me!

COUNTESS 
Do you love my son?

HELENA 
Your pardon, noble mistress!

COUNTESS 
Love you my son?

HELENA 
Do not you love him, madam?

COUNTESS 
Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
The state of your affection; for your passions
Have to the full appeach'd.

HELENA 
Then, I confess,
Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
That before you, and next unto high heaven,
I love your son.
My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
Be not offended; for it hurts not him
That he is loved of me: I follow him not
By any token of presumptuous suit;
Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
Yet never know how that desert should be.
I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
I still pour in the waters of my love
And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
Religious in mine error, I adore
The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
Let not your hate encounter with my love
For loving where you do: but if yourself,
Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
Did ever in so true a flame of liking
Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
That seeks not to find that her search implies,
But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

COUNTESS 
Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
To go to Paris?

HELENA 
Madam, I had.

COUNTESS 
Wherefore? tell true.

HELENA 
I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
You know my father left me some prescriptions
Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
And manifest experience had collected
For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
As notes whose faculties inclusive were
More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
There is a remedy, approved, set down,
To cure the desperate languishings whereof
The king is render'd lost.

COUNTESS 
This was your motive
For Paris, was it? speak.

HELENA 
My lord your son made me to think of this;
Else Paris and the medicine and the king
Had from the conversation of my thoughts
Haply been absent then.

COUNTESS 
But think you, Helen,
If you should tender your supposed aid,
He would receive it? he and his physicians
Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
The danger to itself?

HELENA 
There's something in't,
More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
Of his profession, that his good receipt
Shall for my legacy be sanctified
By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
By such a day and hour.

COUNTESS 
Dost thou believe't?

HELENA 
Ay, madam, knowingly.

COUNTESS 
Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
Means and attendants and my loving greetings
To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

ACT II
SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.

Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES 
KING 
Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
And is enough for both.

First Lord 
'Tis our hope, sir,
After well enter'd soldiers, to return
And find your grace in health.

KING 
No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
Will not confess he owes the malady
That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
Whether I live or die, be you the sons
Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
Those bated that inherit but the fall
Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.

Second Lord 
Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!

KING 
Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
They say, our French lack language to deny,
If they demand: beware of being captives,
Before you serve.

Both 
Our hearts receive your warnings.

KING 
Farewell. Come hither to me.

Exit, attended

First Lord 
O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

PAROLLES 
'Tis not his fault, the spark.

Second Lord 
O, 'tis brave wars!

PAROLLES 
Most admirable: I have seen those wars.

BERTRAM 
I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'

PAROLLES 
An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.

BERTRAM 
I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

First Lord 
There's honour in the theft.

PAROLLES 
Commit it, count.

Second Lord 
I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

BERTRAM 
I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

First Lord 
Farewell, captain.

Second Lord 
Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

PAROLLES 
Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
reports for me.

First Lord 
We shall, noble captain.

Exeunt Lords

PAROLLES 
Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

BERTRAM 
Stay: the king.

Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire

PAROLLES 
[To BERTRAM] Use a more spacious ceremony to the
noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
move under the influence of the most received star;
and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.

BERTRAM 
And I will do so.

PAROLLES 
Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.

Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

Enter LAFEU

LAFEU 
[Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

KING 
I'll fee thee to stand up.

LAFEU 
Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

KING 
I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
And ask'd thee mercy for't.

LAFEU 
Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
Will you be cured of your infirmity?

KING 
No.

LAFEU 
O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
That's able to breathe life into a stone,
Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
And write to her a love-line.

KING 
What 'her' is this?

LAFEU 
Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
If seriously I may convey my thoughts
In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
For that is her demand, and know her business?
That done, laugh well at me.

KING 
Now, good Lafeu,
Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
By wondering how thou took'st it.

LAFEU 
Nay, I'll fit you,
And not be all day neither.

Exit

KING 
Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA

LAFEU 
Nay, come your ways.

KING 
This haste hath wings indeed.

LAFEU 
Nay, come your ways:
This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
That dare leave two together; fare you well.

Exit

KING 
Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

HELENA 
Ay, my good lord.
Gerard de Narbon was my father;
In what he did profess, well found.

KING 
I knew him.

HELENA 
The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
And of his old experience the oily darling,
He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
With that malignant cause wherein the honour
Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
I come to tender it and my appliance
With all bound humbleness.

KING 
We thank you, maiden;
But may not be so credulous of cure,
When our most learned doctors leave us and
The congregated college have concluded
That labouring art can never ransom nature
From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
To prostitute our past-cure malady
To empirics, or to dissever so
Our great self and our credit, to esteem
A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

HELENA 
My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
I will no more enforce mine office on you.
Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
A modest one, to bear me back a again.

KING 
I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
As one near death to those that wish him live:
But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

HELENA 
What I can do can do no hurt to try,
Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
He that of greatest works is finisher
Oft does them by the weakest minister:
So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
From simple sources, and great seas have dried
When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
Oft expectation fails and most oft there
Where most it promises, and oft it hits
Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

KING 
I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

HELENA 
Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
It is not so with Him that all things knows
As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
But most it is presumption in us when
The help of heaven we count the act of men.
Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
I am not an impostor that proclaim
Myself against the level of mine aim;
But know I think and think I know most sure
My art is not past power nor you past cure.

KING 
Are thou so confident? within what space
Hopest thou my cure?

HELENA 
The great'st grace lending grace
Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

KING 
Upon thy certainty and confidence
What darest thou venture?

HELENA 
Tax of impudence,
A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
With vilest torture let my life be ended.

KING 
Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
His powerful sound within an organ weak:
And what impossibility would slay
In common sense, sense saves another way.
Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
That happiness and prime can happy call:
Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
That ministers thine own death if I die.

HELENA 
If I break time, or flinch in property
Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
But, if I help, what do you promise me?

KING 
Make thy demand.

HELENA 
But will you make it even?

KING 
Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

HELENA 
Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
What husband in thy power I will command:
Exempted be from me the arrogance
To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
My low and humble name to propagate
With any branch or image of thy state;
But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

KING 
Here is my hand; the premises observed,
Thy will by my performance shall be served:
So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
More should I question thee, and more I must,
Though more to know could not be more to trust,
From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS and Clown 
COUNTESS 
Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
your breeding.

Clown 
I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
know my business is but to the court.

COUNTESS 
To the court! why, what place make you special,
when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

Clown 
Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
men.

COUNTESS 
Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
questions.

Clown 
It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
buttock, or any buttock.

COUNTESS 
Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

Clown 
As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

COUNTESS 
Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
questions?

Clown 
From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
will fit any question.

COUNTESS 
It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
must fit all demands.

Clown 
But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
do you no harm to learn.

COUNTESS 
To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

Clown 
O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
more, a hundred of them.

COUNTESS 
Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

COUNTESS 
I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

COUNTESS 
You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! spare not me.

COUNTESS 
Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

Clown 
I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

COUNTESS 
I play the noble housewife with the time
To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

Clown 
O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

COUNTESS 
An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
And urge her to a present answer back:
Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
This is not much.

Clown 
Not much commendation to them.

COUNTESS 
Not much employment for you: you understand me?

Clown 
Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

COUNTESS 
Haste you again.

Exeunt severally

SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.

Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES 
LAFEU 
They say miracles are past; and we have our
philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
ourselves to an unknown fear.

PAROLLES 
Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
shot out in our latter times.

BERTRAM 
And so 'tis.

LAFEU 
To be relinquish'd of the artists,--

PAROLLES 
So I say.

LAFEU 
Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

PAROLLES 
So I say.

LAFEU 
Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--

PAROLLES 
Right; so I say.

LAFEU 
That gave him out incurable,--

PAROLLES 
Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

LAFEU 
Not to be helped,--

PAROLLES 
Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--

LAFEU 
Uncertain life, and sure death.

PAROLLES 
Just, you say well; so would I have said.

LAFEU 
I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

PAROLLES 
It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
shall read it in--what do you call there?

LAFEU 
A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

PAROLLES 
That's it; I would have said the very same.

LAFEU 
Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
I speak in respect--

PAROLLES 
Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--

LAFEU 
Very hand of heaven.

PAROLLES 
Ay, so I say.

LAFEU 
In a most weak--

pausing

and debile minister, great power, great
transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
further use to be made than alone the recovery of
the king, as to be--

pausing

generally thankful.

PAROLLES 
I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.

Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire

LAFEU 
Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
able to lead her a coranto.

PAROLLES 
Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?

LAFEU 
'Fore God, I think so.

KING 
Go, call before me all the lords in court.
Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
The confirmation of my promised gift,
Which but attends thy naming.

Enter three or four Lords

Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
I have to use: thy frank election make;
Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

HELENA 
To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

LAFEU 
I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
And writ as little beard.

KING 
Peruse them well:
Not one of those but had a noble father.

HELENA 
Gentlemen,
Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.

All 
We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

HELENA 
I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
That I protest I simply am a maid.
Please it your majesty, I have done already:
The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
We'll ne'er come there again.'

KING 
Make choice; and, see,
Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

HELENA 
Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
And to imperial Love, that god most high,
Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

First Lord 
And grant it.

HELENA 
Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

LAFEU 
I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
for my life.

HELENA 
The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
Love make your fortunes twenty times above
Her that so wishes and her humble love!

Second Lord 
No better, if you please.

HELENA 
My wish receive,
Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

LAFEU 
Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
Turk, to make eunuchs of.

HELENA 
Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

LAFEU 
These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
ne'er got 'em.

HELENA 
You are too young, too happy, and too good,
To make yourself a son out of my blood.

Fourth Lord 
Fair one, I think not so.

LAFEU 
There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
of fourteen; I have known thee already.

HELENA 
[To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give
Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
Into your guiding power. This is the man.

KING 
Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

BERTRAM 
My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
In such a business give me leave to use
The help of mine own eyes.

KING 
Know'st thou not, Bertram,
What she has done for me?

BERTRAM 
Yes, my good lord;
But never hope to know why I should marry her.

KING 
Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.

BERTRAM 
But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
She had her breeding at my father's charge.
A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
Rather corrupt me ever!

KING 
'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
In differences so mighty. If she be
All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
The property by what it is should go,
Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
In these to nature she's immediate heir,
And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
Which challenges itself as honour's born
And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
When rather from our acts we them derive
Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
I can create the rest: virtue and she
Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

BERTRAM 
I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

KING 
Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

HELENA 
That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
Let the rest go.

KING 
My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
That dost in vile misprision shackle up
My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
We, poising us in her defective scale,
Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
It is in us to plant thine honour where
We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
Believe not thy disdain, but presently
Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
Into the staggers and the careless lapse
Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

BERTRAM 
Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
What great creation and what dole of honour
Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
Is as 'twere born so.

KING 
Take her by the hand,
And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
A balance more replete.

BERTRAM 
I take her hand.

KING 
Good fortune and the favour of the king
Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
Shall more attend upon the coming space,
Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES

LAFEU 
[Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.

PAROLLES 
Your pleasure, sir?

LAFEU 
Your lord and master did well to make his
recantation.

PAROLLES 
Recantation! My lord! my master!

LAFEU 
Ay; is it not a language I speak?

PAROLLES 
A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
bloody succeeding. My master!

LAFEU 
Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

PAROLLES 
To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

LAFEU 
To what is count's man: count's master is of
another style.

PAROLLES 
You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.

LAFEU 
I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
title age cannot bring thee.

PAROLLES 
What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

LAFEU 
I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
that thou't scarce worth.

PAROLLES 
Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

LAFEU 
Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee
for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
through thee. Give me thy hand.

PAROLLES 
My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

LAFEU 
Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

PAROLLES 
I have not, my lord, deserved it.

LAFEU 
Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
bate thee a scruple.

PAROLLES 
Well, I shall be wiser.

LAFEU 
Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.

PAROLLES 
My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

LAFEU 
I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
thee, in what motion age will give me leave.

Exit

PAROLLES 
Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
any convenience, an he were double and double a
lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.

Re-enter LAFEU

LAFEU 
Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news
for you: you have a new mistress.

PAROLLES 
I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
lord: whom I serve above is my master.

LAFEU 
Who? God?

PAROLLES 
Ay, sir.

LAFEU 
The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

PAROLLES 
This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

LAFEU 
Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
and honourable personages than the commission of your
birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.

Exit

PAROLLES 
Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
let it be concealed awhile.

Re-enter BERTRAM

BERTRAM 
Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

PAROLLES 
What's the matter, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM 
Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
I will not bed her.

PAROLLES 
What, what, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM 
O my Parolles, they have married me!
I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

PAROLLES 
France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

BERTRAM 
There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
I know not yet.

PAROLLES 
Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
He wears his honour in a box unseen,
That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
Therefore, to the war!

BERTRAM 
It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
That which I durst not speak; his present gift
Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
To the dark house and the detested wife.

PAROLLES 
Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

BERTRAM 
Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

PAROLLES 
Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.

Enter HELENA and Clown 
HELENA 
My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

Clown 
She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
world; but yet she is not well.

HELENA 
If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
not very well?

Clown 
Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

HELENA 
What two things?

Clown 
One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
God send her quickly!

Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES 
Bless you, my fortunate lady!

HELENA 
I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
good fortunes.

PAROLLES 
You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

Clown 
So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
I would she did as you say.

PAROLLES 
Why, I say nothing.

Clown 
Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
is within a very little of nothing.

PAROLLES 
Away! thou'rt a knave.

Clown 
You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
been truth, sir.

PAROLLES 
Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

Clown 
Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
and much fool may you find in you, even to the
world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

PAROLLES 
A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
A very serious business calls on him.
The great prerogative and rite of love,
Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
Which they distil now in the curbed time,
To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
And pleasure drown the brim.

HELENA 
What's his will else?

PAROLLES 
That you will take your instant leave o' the king
And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
Strengthen'd with what apology you think
May make it probable need.

HELENA 
What more commands he?

PAROLLES 
That, having this obtain'd, you presently
Attend his further pleasure.

HELENA 
In every thing I wait upon his will.

PAROLLES 
I shall report it so.

HELENA 
I pray you.

Exit PAROLLES

Come, sirrah.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Paris. The KING's palace.

Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM 
LAFEU 
But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

BERTRAM 
Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

LAFEU 
You have it from his own deliverance.

BERTRAM 
And by other warranted testimony.

LAFEU 
Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.

BERTRAM 
I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
knowledge and accordingly valiant.

LAFEU 
I have then sinned against his experience and
transgressed against his valour; and my state that
way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
us friends; I will pursue the amity.

Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES 
[To BERTRAM] These things shall be done, sir.

LAFEU 
Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

PAROLLES 
Sir?

LAFEU 
O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
workman, a very good tailor.

BERTRAM 
[Aside to PAROLLES] Is she gone to the king?

PAROLLES 
She is.

BERTRAM 
Will she away to-night?

PAROLLES 
As you'll have her.

BERTRAM 
I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
Given order for our horses; and to-night,
When I should take possession of the bride,
End ere I do begin.

LAFEU 
A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a
known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.

BERTRAM 
Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

PAROLLES 
I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
displeasure.

LAFEU 
You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and
out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
question for your residence.

BERTRAM 
It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

LAFEU 
And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.

Exit

PAROLLES 
An idle lord. I swear.

BERTRAM 
I think so.

PAROLLES 
Why, do you not know him?

BERTRAM 
Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

Enter HELENA

HELENA 
I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
For present parting; only he desires
Some private speech with you.

BERTRAM 
I shall obey his will.
You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
The ministration and required office
On my particular. Prepared I was not
For such a business; therefore am I found
So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
That presently you take our way for home;
And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
For my respects are better than they seem
And my appointments have in them a need
Greater than shows itself at the first view
To you that know them not. This to my mother:

Giving a letter

'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
I leave you to your wisdom.

HELENA 
Sir, I can nothing say,
But that I am your most obedient servant.

BERTRAM 
Come, come, no more of that.

HELENA 
And ever shall
With true observance seek to eke out that
Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
To equal my great fortune.

BERTRAM 
Let that go:
My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

HELENA 
Pray, sir, your pardon.

BERTRAM 
Well, what would you say?

HELENA 
I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
What law does vouch mine own.

BERTRAM 
What would you have?

HELENA 
Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
Faith yes;
Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

BERTRAM 
I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

HELENA 
I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

BERTRAM 
Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.

Exit HELENA

Go thou toward home; where I will never come
Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
Away, and for our flight.

PAROLLES 
Bravely, coragio!

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. Florence. The DUKE's palace.

Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers. 
DUKE 
So that from point to point now have you heard
The fundamental reasons of this war,
Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
And more thirsts after.

First Lord 
Holy seems the quarrel
Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
On the opposer.

DUKE 
Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
Would in so just a business shut his bosom
Against our borrowing prayers.

Second Lord 
Good my lord,
The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
But like a common and an outward man,
That the great figure of a council frames
By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
Say what I think of it, since I have found
Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
As often as I guess'd.

DUKE 
Be it his pleasure.

First Lord 
But I am sure the younger of our nature,
That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
Come here for physic.

DUKE 
Welcome shall they be;
And all the honours that can fly from us
Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
When better fall, for your avails they fell:
To-morrow to the field.

Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS and Clown 
COUNTESS 
It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
that he comes not along with her.

Clown 
By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
melancholy man.

COUNTESS 
By what observance, I pray you?

Clown 
Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

COUNTESS 
Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

Opening a letter

Clown 
I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

COUNTESS 
What have we here?

Clown 
E'en that you have there.

Exit

COUNTESS 
[Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
before the report come. If there be breadth enough
in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
to you. Your unfortunate son,
BERTRAM.
This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
To fly the favours of so good a king;
To pluck his indignation on thy head
By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
For the contempt of empire.

Re-enter Clown

Clown 
O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
soldiers and my young lady!

COUNTESS 
What is the matter?

Clown 
Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
thought he would.

COUNTESS 
Why should he be killed?

Clown 
So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
men, though it be the getting of children. Here
they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
hear your son was run away.

Exit

Enter HELENA, and two Gentlemen

First Gentleman 
Save you, good madam.

HELENA 
Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

Second Gentleman 
Do not say so.

COUNTESS 
Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
That the first face of neither, on the start,
Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

Second Gentleman 
Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
Thither we bend again.

HELENA 
Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

Reads

When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
of thy body that I am father to, then call me
husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
This is a dreadful sentence.

COUNTESS 
Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

First Gentleman 
Ay, madam;
And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.

COUNTESS 
I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
But I do wash his name out of my blood,
And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

Second Gentleman 
Ay, madam.

COUNTESS 
And to be a soldier?

Second Gentleman 
Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
The duke will lay upon him all the honour
That good convenience claims.

COUNTESS 
Return you thither?

First Gentleman 
Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

HELENA 
[Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
'Tis bitter.

COUNTESS 
Find you that there?

HELENA 
Ay, madam.

First Gentleman 
'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
heart was not consenting to.

COUNTESS 
Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
There's nothing here that is too good for him
But only she; and she deserves a lord
That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

First Gentleman 
A servant only, and a gentleman
Which I have sometime known.

COUNTESS 
Parolles, was it not?

First Gentleman 
Ay, my good lady, he.

COUNTESS 
A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
My son corrupts a well-derived nature
With his inducement.

First Gentleman 
Indeed, good lady,
The fellow has a deal of that too much,
Which holds him much to have.

COUNTESS 
You're welcome, gentlemen.
I will entreat you, when you see my son,
To tell him that his sword can never win
The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
Written to bear along.

Second Gentleman 
We serve you, madam,
In that and all your worthiest affairs.

COUNTESS 
Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
Will you draw near!

Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen

HELENA 
'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
That chase thee from thy country and expose
Those tender limbs of thine to the event
Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
Whoever charges on his forward breast,
I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
His death was so effected: better 'twere
I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
That all the miseries which nature owes
Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
My being here it is that holds thee hence:
Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
The air of paradise did fan the house
And angels officed all: I will be gone,
That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

Exit

SCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.

Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets 
DUKE 
The general of our horse thou art; and we,
Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
Upon thy promising fortune.

BERTRAM 
Sir, it is
A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
To the extreme edge of hazard.

DUKE 
Then go thou forth;
And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
As thy auspicious mistress!

BERTRAM 
This very day,
Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS and Steward 
COUNTESS 
Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
Might you not know she would do as she has done,
By sending me a letter? Read it again.

Steward 
[Reads]
I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
His taken labours bid him me forgive;
I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
He is too good and fair for death and me:
Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

COUNTESS 
Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
I could have well diverted her intents,
Which thus she hath prevented.

Steward 
Pardon me, madam:
If I had given you this at over-night,
She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,
Pursuit would be but vain.

COUNTESS 
What angel shall
Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
To this unworthy husband of his wife;
Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
He will return; and hope I may that she,
Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
Led hither by pure love: which of them both
Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
To make distinction: provide this messenger:
My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.

Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other Citizens 
Widow 
Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we
shall lose all the sight.

DIANA 
They say the French count has done most honourable service.

Widow 
It is reported that he has taken their greatest
commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
duke's brother.

Tucket

We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.

MARIANA 
Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
no legacy is so rich as honesty.

Widow 
I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
by a gentleman his companion.

MARIANA 
I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
though there were no further danger known but the
modesty which is so lost.

DIANA 
You shall not need to fear me.

Widow 
I hope so.

Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim

Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
my house; thither they send one another: I'll
question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

HELENA 
To Saint Jaques le Grand.
Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

Widow 
At the Saint Francis here beside the port.

HELENA 
Is this the way?

Widow 
Ay, marry, is't.

A march afar

Hark you! they come this way.
If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
But till the troops come by,
I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
The rather, for I think I know your hostess
As ample as myself.

HELENA 
Is it yourself?

Widow 
If you shall please so, pilgrim.

HELENA 
I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

Widow 
You came, I think, from France?

HELENA 
I did so.

Widow 
Here you shall see a countryman of yours
That has done worthy service.

HELENA 
His name, I pray you.

DIANA 
The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

HELENA 
But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
His face I know not.

DIANA 
Whatsome'er he is,
He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
Against his liking: think you it is so?

HELENA 
Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

DIANA 
There is a gentleman that serves the count
Reports but coarsely of her.

HELENA 
What's his name?

DIANA 
Monsieur Parolles.

HELENA 
O, I believe with him,
In argument of praise, or to the worth
Of the great count himself, she is too mean
To have her name repeated: all her deserving
Is a reserved honesty, and that
I have not heard examined.

DIANA 
Alas, poor lady!
'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
Of a detesting lord.

Widow 
I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
A shrewd turn, if she pleased.

HELENA 
How do you mean?
May be the amorous count solicits her
In the unlawful purpose.

Widow 
He does indeed;
And brokes with all that can in such a suit
Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
In honestest defence.

MARIANA 
The gods forbid else!

Widow 
So, now they come:

Drum and Colours

Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army

That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
That, Escalus.

HELENA 
Which is the Frenchman?

DIANA 
He;
That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

HELENA 
I like him well.

DIANA 
'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
I would Poison that vile rascal.

HELENA 
Which is he?

DIANA 
That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?

HELENA 
Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

PAROLLES 
Lose our drum! well.

MARIANA 
He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.

Widow 
Marry, hang you!

MARIANA 
And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army

Widow 
The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
Already at my house.

HELENA 
I humbly thank you:
Please it this matron and this gentle maid
To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
Worthy the note.

BOTH 
We'll take your offer kindly.

Exeunt

SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.

Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords 
Second Lord 
Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
way.

First Lord 
If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
more in your respect.

Second Lord 
On my life, my lord, a bubble.

BERTRAM 
Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

Second Lord 
Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
without any malice, but to speak of him as my
kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
entertainment.

First Lord 
It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.

BERTRAM 
I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

First Lord 
None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.

Second Lord 
I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
present at his examination: if he do not, for the
promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
intelligence in his power against you, and that with
the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
trust my judgment in any thing.

First Lord 
O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
melted, if you give him not John Drum's
entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
Here he comes.

Enter PAROLLES

Second Lord 
[Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,
hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
off his drum in any hand.

BERTRAM 
How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
disposition.

First Lord 
A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

PAROLLES 
'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!

First Lord 
That was not to be blamed in the command of the
service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
himself could not have prevented, if he had been
there to command.

BERTRAM 
Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
not to be recovered.

PAROLLES 
It might have been recovered.

BERTRAM 
It might; but it is not now.

PAROLLES 
It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
performer, I would have that drum or another, or
'hic jacet.'

BERTRAM 
Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
and extend to you what further becomes his
greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
worthiness.

PAROLLES 
By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

BERTRAM 
But you must not now slumber in it.

PAROLLES 
I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
and by midnight look to hear further from me.

BERTRAM 
May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

PAROLLES 
I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
the attempt I vow.

BERTRAM 
I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

PAROLLES 
I love not many words.

Exit

Second Lord 
No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
damned than to do't?

First Lord 
You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
when you find him out, you have him ever after.

BERTRAM 
Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

Second Lord 
None in the world; but return with an invention and
clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

First Lord 
We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
very night.

Second Lord 
I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

BERTRAM 
Your brother he shall go along with me.

Second Lord 
As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

Exit

BERTRAM 
Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
The lass I spoke of.

First Lord 
But you say she's honest.

BERTRAM 
That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
Will you go see her?

First Lord 
With all my heart, my lord.

Exeunt

SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.

Enter HELENA and Widow 
HELENA 
If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
I know not how I shall assure you further,
But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

Widow 
Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
And would not put my reputation now
In any staining act.

HELENA 
Nor would I wish you.
First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
Err in bestowing it.

Widow 
I should believe you:
For you have show'd me that which well approves
You're great in fortune.

HELENA 
Take this purse of gold,
And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
Which I will over-pay and pay again
When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
Now his important blood will nought deny
That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
That downward hath succeeded in his house
From son to son, some four or five descents
Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
Howe'er repented after.

Widow 
Now I see
The bottom of your purpose.

HELENA 
You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
Herself most chastely absent: after this,
To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
To what is passed already.

Widow 
I have yielded:
Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
That time and place with this deceit so lawful
May prove coherent. Every night he comes
With musics of all sorts and songs composed
To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
As if his life lay on't.

HELENA 
Why then to-night
Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
But let's about it.

Exeunt


ACT IV
SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.

Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush 
Second Lord 
He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
language you will: though you understand it not
yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
understand him, unless some one among us whom we
must produce for an interpreter.

First Soldier 
Good captain, let me be the interpreter.

Second Lord 
Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?

First Soldier 
No, sir, I warrant you.

Second Lord 
But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?

First Soldier 
E'en such as you speak to me.

Second Lord 
He must think us some band of strangers i' the
adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES 
Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
done? It must be a very plausive invention that
carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
daring the reports of my tongue.

Second Lord 
This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
was guilty of.

PAROLLES 
What the devil should move me to undertake the
recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

Second Lord 
Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
that he is?

PAROLLES 
I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.

Second Lord 
We cannot afford you so.

PAROLLES 
Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
stratagem.

Second Lord 
'Twould not do.

PAROLLES 
Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.

Second Lord 
Hardly serve.

PAROLLES 
Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.

Second Lord 
How deep?

PAROLLES 
Thirty fathom.

Second Lord 
Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.

PAROLLES 
I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
I recovered it.

Second Lord 
You shall hear one anon.

PAROLLES 
A drum now of the enemy's,--

Alarum within

Second Lord 
Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.

All 
Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.

PAROLLES 
O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.

They seize and blindfold him

First Soldier 
Boskos thromuldo boskos.

PAROLLES 
I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
And I shall lose my life for want of language;
If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

First Soldier 
Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.

PAROLLES 
O!

First Soldier 
O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.

Second Lord 
Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

First Soldier 
The general is content to spare thee yet;
And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
Something to save thy life.

PAROLLES 
O, let me live!
And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
Which you will wonder at.

First Soldier 
But wilt thou faithfully?

PAROLLES 
If I do not, damn me.

First Soldier 
Acordo linta.
Come on; thou art granted space.

Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within

Second Lord 
Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,
We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
Till we do hear from them.

Second Soldier 
Captain, I will.

Second Lord 
A' will betray us all unto ourselves:
Inform on that.

Second Soldier 
So I will, sir.

Second Lord 
Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.

Exeunt

SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.

Enter BERTRAM and DIANA 
BERTRAM 
They told me that your name was Fontibell.

DIANA 
No, my good lord, Diana.

BERTRAM 
Titled goddess;
And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
In your fine frame hath love no quality?
If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
You are no maiden, but a monument:
When you are dead, you should be such a one
As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
And now you should be as your mother was
When your sweet self was got.

DIANA 
She then was honest.

BERTRAM 
So should you be.

DIANA 
No:
My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
As you owe to your wife.

BERTRAM 
No more o' that;
I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
Do thee all rights of service.

DIANA 
Ay, so you serve us
Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
And mock us with our bareness.

BERTRAM 
How have I sworn!

DIANA 
'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
What is not holy, that we swear not by,
But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
If I should swear by God's great attributes,
I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
To swear by him whom I protest to love,
That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
At least in my opinion.

BERTRAM 
Change it, change it;
Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
But give thyself unto my sick desires,
Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
My love as it begins shall so persever.

DIANA 
I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

BERTRAM 
I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
To give it from me.

DIANA 
Will you not, my lord?

BERTRAM 
It is an honour 'longing to our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose.

DIANA 
Mine honour's such a ring:
My chastity's the jewel of our house,
Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
Against your vain assault.

BERTRAM 
Here, take my ring:
My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
And I'll be bid by thee.

DIANA 
When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
And on your finger in the night I'll put
Another ring, that what in time proceeds
May token to the future our past deeds.
Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

BERTRAM 
A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

Exit

DIANA 
For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
You may so in the end.
My mother told me just how he would woo,
As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
Only in this disguise I think't no sin
To cozen him that would unjustly win.

Exit

SCENE III. The Florentine camp.

Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers 
First Lord 
You have not given him his mother's letter?

Second Lord 
I have delivered it an hour since: there is
something in't that stings his nature; for on the
reading it he changed almost into another man.

First Lord 
He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.

Second Lord 
Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.

First Lord 
When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
grave of it.

Second Lord 
He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
made in the unchaste composition.

First Lord 
Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
what things are we!

Second Lord 
Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
of all treasons, we still see them reveal
themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
so he that in this action contrives against his own
nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.

First Lord 
Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
company to-night?

Second Lord 
Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.

First Lord 
That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
set this counterfeit.

Second Lord 
We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
presence must be the whip of the other.

First Lord 
In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?

Second Lord 
I hear there is an overture of peace.

First Lord 
Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

Second Lord 
What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
higher, or return again into France?

First Lord 
I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
of his council.

Second Lord 
Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
of his act.

First Lord 
Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
now she sings in heaven.

Second Lord 
How is this justified?

First Lord 
The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
makes her story true, even to the point of her
death: her death itself, which could not be her
office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
the rector of the place.

Second Lord 
Hath the count all this intelligence?

First Lord 
Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
point, so to the full arming of the verity.

Second Lord 
I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.

First Lord 
How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!

Second Lord 
And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
with a shame as ample.

First Lord 
The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.

Enter a Messenger

How now! where's your master?

Servant 
He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
morning for France. The duke hath offered him
letters of commendations to the king.

Second Lord 
They shall be no more than needful there, if they
were more than they can commend.

First Lord 
They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
Here's his lordship now.

Enter BERTRAM

How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?

BERTRAM 
I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
that I have not ended yet.

Second Lord 
If the business be of any difficulty, and this
morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
your lordship.

BERTRAM 
I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

Second Lord 
Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
poor gallant knave.

BERTRAM 
No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

Second Lord 
I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?

BERTRAM 
Nothing of me, has a'?

Second Lord 
His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
are, you must have the patience to hear it.

Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier

BERTRAM 
A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
me: hush, hush!

First Lord 
Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa

First Soldier 
He calls for the tortures: what will you say
without 'em?

PAROLLES 
I will confess what I know without constraint: if
ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

First Soldier 
Bosko chimurcho.

First Lord 
Boblibindo chicurmurco.

First Soldier 
You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.

PAROLLES 
And truly, as I hope to live.

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse the
duke is strong.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES 
Five or six thousand; but very weak and
unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
and credit and as I hope to live.

First Soldier 
Shall I set down your answer so?

PAROLLES 
Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.

BERTRAM 
All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

First Lord 
You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
his dagger.

Second Lord 
I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
by wearing his apparel neatly.

First Soldier 
Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES 
Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.

First Lord 
He's very near the truth in this.

BERTRAM 
But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
delivers it.

PAROLLES 
Poor rogues, I pray you, say.

First Soldier 
Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES 
I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
rogues are marvellous poor.

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are
a-foot.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES 
By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.

BERTRAM 
What shall be done to him?

First Lord 
Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
condition, and what credit I have with the duke.

First Soldier 
Well, that's set down.

Reads

'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
do you know of it?

PAROLLES 
I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
the inter'gatories: demand them singly.

First Soldier 
Do you know this Captain Dumain?

PAROLLES 
I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
say him nay.

BERTRAM 
Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

First Soldier 
Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?

PAROLLES 
Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

First Lord 
Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
lordship anon.

First Soldier 
What is his reputation with the duke?

PAROLLES 
The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.

First Soldier 
Marry, we'll search.

PAROLLES 
In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
in my tent.

First Soldier 
Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?

PAROLLES 
I do not know if it be it or no.

BERTRAM 
Our interpreter does it well.

First Lord 
Excellently.

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--

PAROLLES 
That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.

First Soldier 
Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.

PAROLLES 
My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.

BERTRAM 
Damnable both-sides rogue!

First Soldier 
[Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
After he scores, he never pays the score:
Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
PAROLLES.'

BERTRAM 
He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
in's forehead.

Second Lord 
This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
linguist and the armipotent soldier.

BERTRAM 
I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
he's a cat to me.

First Soldier 
I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
fain to hang you.

PAROLLES 
My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
die; but that, my offences being many, I would
repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.

First Soldier 
We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
his valour: what is his honesty?

PAROLLES 
He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
such volubility, that you would think truth were a
fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
every thing that an honest man should not have; what
an honest man should have, he has nothing.

First Lord 
I begin to love him for this.

BERTRAM 
For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
him for me, he's more and more a cat.

First Soldier 
What say you to his expertness in war?

PAROLLES 
Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
this I am not certain.

First Lord 
He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
rarity redeems him.

BERTRAM 
A pox on him, he's a cat still.

First Soldier 
His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.

PAROLLES 
Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
succession for it perpetually.

First Soldier 
What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?

Second Lord 
Why does be ask him of me?

First Soldier 
What's he?

PAROLLES 
E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
on he has the cramp.

First Soldier 
If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
the Florentine?

PAROLLES 
Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.

First Soldier 
I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.

PAROLLES 
[Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?

First Soldier 
There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
general says, you that have so traitorously
discovered the secrets of your army and made such
pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.

PAROLLES 
O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!

First Lord 
That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.

Unblinding him

So, look about you: know you any here?

BERTRAM 
Good morrow, noble captain.

Second Lord 
God bless you, Captain Parolles.

First Lord 
God save you, noble captain.

Second Lord 
Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
I am for France.

First Lord 
Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
but fare you well.

Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords

First Soldier 
You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
has a knot on't yet

PAROLLES 
Who cannot be crushed with a plot?

First Soldier 
If you could find out a country where but women were
that had received so much shame, you might begin an
impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
too: we shall speak of you there.

Exit with Soldiers

PAROLLES 
Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
As captain shall: simply the thing I am
Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
that every braggart shall be found an ass.
Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
There's place and means for every man alive.
I'll after them.

Exit

SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.

Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA 
HELENA 
That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
One of the greatest in the Christian world
Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
Time was, I did him a desired office,
Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
We have convenient convoy. You must know
I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
And by the leave of my good lord the king,
We'll be before our welcome.

Widow 
Gentle madam,
You never had a servant to whose trust
Your business was more welcome.

HELENA 
Nor you, mistress,
Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
As it hath fated her to be my motive
And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
With what it loathes for that which is away.
But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
Something in my behalf.

DIANA 
Let death and honesty
Go with your impositions, I am yours
Upon your will to suffer.

HELENA 
Yet, I pray you:
But with the word the time will bring on summer,
When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:
All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;
Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown 
LAFEU 
No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

COUNTESS 
I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
could not have owed her a more rooted love.

LAFEU 
'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.

Clown 
Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

LAFEU 
They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.

Clown 
I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
skill in grass.

LAFEU 
Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?

Clown 
A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.

LAFEU 
Your distinction?

Clown 
I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.

LAFEU 
So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

Clown 
And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.

LAFEU 
I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.

Clown 
At your service.

LAFEU 
No, no, no.

Clown 
Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
great a prince as you are.

LAFEU 
Who's that? a Frenchman?

Clown 
Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
is more hotter in France than there.

LAFEU 
What prince is that?

Clown 
The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
darkness; alias, the devil.

LAFEU 
Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
serve him still.

Clown 
I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
leads to the broad gate and the great fire.

LAFEU 
Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
looked to, without any tricks.

Clown 
If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.

Exit

LAFEU 
A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

COUNTESS 
So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.

LAFEU 
I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
conceived against your son, there is no fitter
matter. How does your ladyship like it?

COUNTESS 
With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
happily effected.

LAFEU 
His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
intelligence hath seldom failed.

COUNTESS 
It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
die. I have letters that my son will be here
to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
with me till they meet together.

LAFEU 
Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
safely be admitted.

COUNTESS 
You need but plead your honourable privilege.

LAFEU 
Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
thank my God it holds yet.

Re-enter Clown

Clown 
O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
half, but his right cheek is worn bare.

LAFEU 
A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
of honour; so belike is that.

Clown 
But it is your carbonadoed face.

LAFEU 
Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
with the young noble soldier.

Clown 
Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
and nod at every man.

Exeunt


ACT V
SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.

Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA, with two Attendants 
HELENA 
But this exceeding posting day and night
Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
But since you have made the days and nights as one,
To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
Be bold you do so grow in my requital
As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

Enter a Gentleman

This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

Gentleman 
And you.

HELENA 
Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

Gentleman 
I have been sometimes there.

HELENA 
I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
From the report that goes upon your goodness;
An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
The use of your own virtues, for the which
I shall continue thankful.

Gentleman 
What's your will?

HELENA 
That it will please you
To give this poor petition to the king,
And aid me with that store of power you have
To come into his presence.

Gentleman 
The king's not here.

HELENA 
Not here, sir!

Gentleman 
Not, indeed:
He hence removed last night and with more haste
Than is his use.

Widow 
Lord, how we lose our pains!

HELENA 
ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

Gentleman 
Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
Whither I am going.

HELENA 
I do beseech you, sir,
Since you are like to see the king before me,
Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
Which I presume shall render you no blame
But rather make you thank your pains for it.
I will come after you with what good speed
Our means will make us means.

Gentleman 
This I'll do for you.

HELENA 
And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
Go, go, provide.

Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.

Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following 
PAROLLES 
Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this
letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to
you, when I have held familiarity with fresher
clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's
mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
displeasure.

Clown 
Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
Prithee, allow the wind.

PAROLLES 
Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake
but by a metaphor.

Clown 
Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
thee further.

PAROLLES 
Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

Clown 
Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
comes himself.

Enter LAFEU

Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
your lordship.

Exit

PAROLLES 
My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
scratched.

LAFEU 
And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to
pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the
knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves
thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for
you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:
I am for other business.

PAROLLES 
I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.

LAFEU 
You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;
save your word.

PAROLLES 
My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

LAFEU 
You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!
give me your hand. How does your drum?

PAROLLES 
O my good lord, you were the first that found me!

LAFEU 
Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.

PAROLLES 
It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,
for you did bring me out.

LAFEU 
Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once
both the office of God and the devil? One brings
thee in grace and the other brings thee out.

Trumpets sound

The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,
inquire further after me; I had talk of you last
night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall
eat; go to, follow.

PAROLLES 
I praise God for you.

Exeunt

SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants 
KING 
We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
Her estimation home.

COUNTESS 
'Tis past, my liege;
And I beseech your majesty to make it
Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
O'erbears it and burns on.

KING 
My honour'd lady,
I have forgiven and forgotten all;
Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
And watch'd the time to shoot.

LAFEU 
This I must say,
But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
Offence of mighty note; but to himself
The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
Humbly call'd mistress.

KING 
Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
The nature of his great offence is dead,
And deeper than oblivion we do bury
The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
So 'tis our will he should.

Gentleman 
I shall, my liege.

Exit

KING 
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?

LAFEU 
All that he is hath reference to your highness.

KING 
Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
That set him high in fame.

Enter BERTRAM

LAFEU 
He looks well on't.

KING 
I am not a day of season,
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
In me at once: but to the brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
The time is fair again.

BERTRAM 
My high-repented blames,
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

KING 
All is whole;
Not one word more of the consumed time.
Let's take the instant by the forward top;
For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
The daughter of this lord?

BERTRAM 
Admiringly, my liege, at first
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object: thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
The dust that did offend it.

KING 
Well excused:
That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
To the great sender turns a sour offence,
Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
Make trivial price of serious things we have,
Not knowing them until we know their grave:
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
To see our widower's second marriage-day.

COUNTESS 
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

LAFEU 
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
Must be digested, give a favour from you
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
That she may quickly come.

BERTRAM gives a ring

By my old beard,
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
The last that e'er I took her at court,
I saw upon her finger.

BERTRAM 
Hers it was not.

KING 
Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
Necessitied to help, that by this token
I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
her
Of what should stead her most?

BERTRAM 
My gracious sovereign,
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
The ring was never hers.

COUNTESS 
Son, on my life,
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
At her life's rate.

LAFEU 
I am sure I saw her wear it.

BERTRAM 
You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture, she ceased
In heavy satisfaction and would never
Receive the ring again.

KING 
Plutus himself,
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
Hath not in nature's mystery more science
Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
That you are well acquainted with yourself,
Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
That she would never put it from her finger,
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
Where you have never come, or sent it us
Upon her great disaster.

BERTRAM 
She never saw it.

KING 
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
And makest conjectural fears to come into me
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
More than to see this ring. Take him away.

Guards seize BERTRAM

My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
We'll sift this matter further.

BERTRAM 
If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
Where yet she never was.

Exit, guarded

KING 
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

Enter a Gentleman

Gentleman 
Gracious sovereign,
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
Here's a petition from a Florentine,
Who hath for four or five removes come short
To tender it herself. I undertook it,
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
Is here attending: her business looks in her
With an importing visage; and she told me,
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
Your highness with herself.

KING 
[Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
DIANA CAPILET.

LAFEU 
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
this: I'll none of him.

KING 
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
Go speedily and bring again the count.
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
Was foully snatch'd.

COUNTESS 
Now, justice on the doers!

Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded

KING 
I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
Yet you desire to marry.

Enter Widow and DIANA

What woman's that?

DIANA 
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
Derived from the ancient Capilet:
My suit, as I do understand, you know,
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

Widow 
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
And both shall cease, without your remedy.

KING 
Come hither, count; do you know these women?

BERTRAM 
My lord, I neither can nor will deny
But that I know them: do they charge me further?

DIANA 
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

BERTRAM 
She's none of mine, my lord.

DIANA 
If you shall marry,
You give away this hand, and that is mine;
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
You give away myself, which is known mine;
For I by vow am so embodied yours,
That she which marries you must marry me,
Either both or none.

LAFEU 
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
are no husband for her.

BERTRAM 
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here.

KING 
Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
Than in my thought it lies.

DIANA 
Good my lord,
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
He had not my virginity.

KING 
What say'st thou to her?

BERTRAM 
She's impudent, my lord,
And was a common gamester to the camp.

DIANA 
He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
He might have bought me at a common price:
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
If I be one.

COUNTESS 
He blushes, and 'tis it:
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
That ring's a thousand proofs.

KING 
Methought you said
You saw one here in court could witness it.

DIANA 
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

LAFEU 
I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

KING 
Find him, and bring him hither.

Exit an Attendant

BERTRAM 
What of him?
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
That will speak any thing?

KING 
She hath that ring of yours.

BERTRAM 
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
She knew her distance and did angle for me,
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
As all impediments in fancy's course
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
And I had that which any inferior might
At market-price have bought.

DIANA 
I must be patient:
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
And give me mine again.

BERTRAM 
I have it not.

KING 
What ring was yours, I pray you?

DIANA 
Sir, much like
The same upon your finger.

KING 
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

DIANA 
And this was it I gave him, being abed.

KING 
The story then goes false, you threw it him
Out of a casement.

DIANA 
I have spoke the truth.

Enter PAROLLES

BERTRAM 
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

KING 
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
Is this the man you speak of?

DIANA 
Ay, my lord.

KING 
Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
By him and by this woman here what know you?

PAROLLES 
So please your majesty, my master hath been an
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
which gentlemen have.

KING 
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

PAROLLES 
Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

KING 
How, I pray you?

PAROLLES 
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

KING 
How is that?

PAROLLES 
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

KING 
As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
equivocal companion is this!

PAROLLES 
I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

LAFEU 
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

DIANA 
Do you know he promised me marriage?

PAROLLES 
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

KING 
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

PAROLLES 
Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
was in that credit with them at that time that I
knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
as promising her marriage, and things which would
derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
speak what I know.

KING 
Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
evidence; therefore stand aside.
This ring, you say, was yours?

DIANA 
Ay, my good lord.

KING 
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

DIANA 
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

KING 
Who lent it you?

DIANA 
It was not lent me neither.

KING 
Where did you find it, then?

DIANA 
I found it not.

KING 
If it were yours by none of all these ways,
How could you give it him?

DIANA 
I never gave it him.

LAFEU 
This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
and on at pleasure.

KING 
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

DIANA 
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

KING 
Take her away; I do not like her now;
To prison with her: and away with him.
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
Thou diest within this hour.

DIANA 
I'll never tell you.

KING 
Take her away.

DIANA 
I'll put in bail, my liege.

KING 
I think thee now some common customer.

DIANA 
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

KING 
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

DIANA 
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

KING 
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

DIANA 
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

Exit Widow

The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
And at that time he got his wife with child:
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
And now behold the meaning.

Re-enter Widow, with HELENA

KING 
Is there no exorcist
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is't real that I see?

HELENA 
No, my good lord;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
The name and not the thing.

BERTRAM 
Both, both. O, pardon!

HELENA 
O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
'When from my finger you can get this ring
And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

BERTRAM 
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

HELENA 
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
Deadly divorce step between me and you!
O my dear mother, do I see you living?

LAFEU 
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

To PAROLLES

Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

KING 
Let us from point to point this story know,
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

To DIANA

If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
Of that and all the progress, more or less,
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

Flourish

EPILOGUE

KING 
The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
All is well ended, if this suit be won,
That you express content; which we will pay,
With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

ACT I
SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM 
ORLANDO 
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

ADAM 
Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ORLANDO 
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
shake me up.

Enter OLIVER

OLIVER 
Now, sir! what make you here?

ORLANDO 
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.

OLIVER 
What mar you then, sir?

ORLANDO 
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

OLIVER 
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

ORLANDO 
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
come to such penury?

OLIVER 
Know you where your are, sir?

ORLANDO 
O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.

OLIVER 
Know you before whom, sir?

ORLANDO 
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
condition of blood, you should so know me. The
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
you are the first-born; but the same tradition
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
nearer to his reverence.

OLIVER 
What, boy!

ORLANDO 
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

OLIVER 
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

ORLANDO 
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.

ADAM 
Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
remembrance, be at accord.

OLIVER 
Let me go, I say.

ORLANDO 
I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
father charged you in his will to give me good
education: you have trained me like a peasant,
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.

OLIVER 
And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
pray you, leave me.

ORLANDO 
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

OLIVER 
Get you with him, you old dog.

ADAM 
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
he would not have spoke such a word.

Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER 
Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!

Enter DENNIS

DENNIS 
Calls your worship?

OLIVER 
Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

DENNIS 
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
access to you.

OLIVER 
Call him in.

Exit DENNIS

'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.

Enter CHARLES

CHARLES 
Good morrow to your worship.

OLIVER 
Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
new court?

CHARLES 
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

OLIVER 
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
banished with her father?

CHARLES 
O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
that she would have followed her exile, or have died
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.

OLIVER 
Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES 
They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

OLIVER 
What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

CHARLES 
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
withal, that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will.

OLIVER 
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother: therefore use thy
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES 
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
so God keep your worship!

OLIVER 
Farewell, good Charles.

Exit CHARLES

Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

Exit

SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.

Enter CELIA and ROSALIND 
CELIA 
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND 
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA 
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.

ROSALIND 
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
rejoice in yours.

CELIA 
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce, I will render thee again in
affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

ROSALIND 
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
me see; what think you of falling in love?

CELIA 
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again.

ROSALIND 
What shall be our sport, then?

CELIA 
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

ROSALIND 
I would we could do so, for her benefits are
mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

CELIA 
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill-favouredly.

ROSALIND 
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
not in the lineaments of Nature.

Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA 
No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND 
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
Nature's wit.

CELIA 
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
wit! whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE 
Mistress, you must come away to your father.

CELIA 
Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE 
No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

ROSALIND 
Where learned you that oath, fool?

TOUCHSTONE 
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
yet was not the knight forsworn.

CELIA 
How prove you that, in the great heap of your
knowledge?

ROSALIND 
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

TOUCHSTONE 
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA 
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE 
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

CELIA 
Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE 
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

CELIA 
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.

TOUCHSTONE 
The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly.

CELIA 
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.

ROSALIND 
With his mouth full of news.

CELIA 
Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.

ROSALIND 
Then shall we be news-crammed.

CELIA 
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.

Enter LE BEAU

Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?

LE BEAU 
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

CELIA 
Sport! of what colour?

LE BEAU 
What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND 
As wit and fortune will.

TOUCHSTONE 
Or as the Destinies decree.

CELIA 
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

TOUCHSTONE 
Nay, if I keep not my rank,--

ROSALIND 
Thou losest thy old smell.

LE BEAU 
You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
