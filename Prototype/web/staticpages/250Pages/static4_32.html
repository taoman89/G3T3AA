GLOUCESTER 
Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.

LADY ANNE 
Some dungeon.

GLOUCESTER 
Your bed-chamber.

LADY ANNE 
I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!

GLOUCESTER 
So will it, madam till I lie with you.

LADY ANNE 
I hope so.

GLOUCESTER 
I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
And fall somewhat into a slower method,
Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
As blameful as the executioner?

LADY ANNE 
Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.

GLOUCESTER 
Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
To undertake the death of all the world,
So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.

LADY ANNE 
If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.

GLOUCESTER 
These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
As all the world is cheered by the sun,
So I by that; it is my day, my life.

LADY ANNE 
Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!

GLOUCESTER 
Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.

LADY ANNE 
I would I were, to be revenged on thee.

GLOUCESTER 
It is a quarrel most unnatural,
To be revenged on him that loveth you.

LADY ANNE 
It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
To be revenged on him that slew my husband.

GLOUCESTER 
He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
Did it to help thee to a better husband.

LADY ANNE 
His better doth not breathe upon the earth.

GLOUCESTER 
He lives that loves thee better than he could.

LADY ANNE 
Name him.

GLOUCESTER 
Plantagenet.

LADY ANNE 
Why, that was he.

GLOUCESTER 
The selfsame name, but one of better nature.

LADY ANNE 
Where is he?

GLOUCESTER 
Here.

She spitteth at him

Why dost thou spit at me?

LADY ANNE 
Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!

GLOUCESTER 
Never came poison from so sweet a place.

LADY ANNE 
Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.

GLOUCESTER 
Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.

LADY ANNE 
Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!

GLOUCESTER 
I would they were, that I might die at once;
For now they kill me with a living death.
Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
No, when my father York and Edward wept,
To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
Told the sad story of my father's death,
And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
I never sued to friend nor enemy;
My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.

She looks scornfully at him

Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
And humbly beg the death upon my knee.

He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword

Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.

Here she lets fall the sword

Take up the sword again, or take up me.

LADY ANNE 
Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
I will not be the executioner.

GLOUCESTER 
Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.

LADY ANNE 
I have already.

GLOUCESTER 
Tush, that was in thy rage:
Speak it again, and, even with the word,
That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.

LADY ANNE 
I would I knew thy heart.

GLOUCESTER 
'Tis figured in my tongue.

LADY ANNE 
I fear me both are false.

GLOUCESTER 
Then never man was true.

LADY ANNE 
Well, well, put up your sword.

GLOUCESTER 
Say, then, my peace is made.

LADY ANNE 
That shall you know hereafter.

GLOUCESTER 
But shall I live in hope?

LADY ANNE 
All men, I hope, live so.

GLOUCESTER 
Vouchsafe to wear this ring.

LADY ANNE 
To take is not to give.

GLOUCESTER 
Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.

LADY ANNE 
What is it?

GLOUCESTER 
That it would please thee leave these sad designs
To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
And presently repair to Crosby Place;
Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
I will with all expedient duty see you:
For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
Grant me this boon.

LADY ANNE 
With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
To see you are become so penitent.
Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.

GLOUCESTER 
Bid me farewell.

LADY ANNE 
'Tis more than you deserve;
But since you teach me how to flatter you,
Imagine I have said farewell already.

Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY

GLOUCESTER 
Sirs, take up the corse.

GENTLEMEN 
Towards Chertsey, noble lord?

GLOUCESTER 
No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.

Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER

Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
Was ever woman in this humour won?
I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
Having God, her conscience, and these bars
against me,
And I nothing to back my suit at all,
But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
Ha!
Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
Framed in the prodigality of nature,
Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
The spacious world cannot again afford
And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
And made her widow to a woful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
I do mistake my person all this while:
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
And entertain some score or two of tailors,
To study fashions to adorn my body:
Since I am crept in favour with myself,
Will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
That I may see my shadow as I pass.

Exit

SCENE III. The palace.

Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY 
RIVERS 
Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
Will soon recover his accustom'd health.

GREY 
In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
If he were dead, what would betide of me?

RIVERS 
No other harm but loss of such a lord.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
The loss of such a lord includes all harm.

GREY 
The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
To be your comforter when he is gone.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Oh, he is young and his minority
Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
A man that loves not me, nor none of you.

RIVERS 
Is it concluded that he shall be protector?

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
It is determined, not concluded yet:
But so it must be, if the king miscarry.

Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY

GREY 
Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.

BUCKINGHAM 
Good time of day unto your royal grace!

DERBY 
God make your majesty joyful as you have been!

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
I hate not you for her proud arrogance.

DERBY 
I do beseech you, either not believe
The envious slanders of her false accusers;
Or, if she be accused in true report,
Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.

RIVERS 
Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?

DERBY 
But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
Are come from visiting his majesty.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
What likelihood of his amendment, lords?

BUCKINGHAM 
Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
God grant him health! Did you confer with him?

BUCKINGHAM 
Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
And sent to warn them to his royal presence.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Would all were well! but that will never be
I fear our happiness is at the highest.

Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET

GLOUCESTER 
They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
Who are they that complain unto the king,
That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
I must be held a rancorous enemy.
Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
But thus his simple truth must be abused
By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?

RIVERS 
To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?

GLOUCESTER 
To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
The king, of his own royal disposition,
And not provoked by any suitor else;
Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
Which in your outward actions shows itself
Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.

GLOUCESTER 
I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
Since every Jack became a gentleman
There's many a gentle person made a Jack.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
Gloucester;
You envy my advancement and my friends':
God grant we never may have need of you!

GLOUCESTER 
Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
Myself disgraced, and the nobility
Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
Are daily given to ennoble those
That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
By Him that raised me to this careful height
From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
I never did incense his majesty
Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
An earnest advocate to plead for him.
My lord, you do me shameful injury,
Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.

GLOUCESTER 
You may deny that you were not the cause
Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.

RIVERS 
She may, my lord, for--

GLOUCESTER 
She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
She may do more, sir, than denying that:
She may help you to many fair preferments,
And then deny her aiding hand therein,
And lay those honours on your high deserts.
What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--

RIVERS 
What, marry, may she?

GLOUCESTER 
What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
I wis your grandam had a worser match.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
With those gross taunts I often have endured.
I had rather be a country servant-maid
Than a great queen, with this condition,
To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:

Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind

Small joy have I in being England's queen.

QUEEN MARGARET 
And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.

GLOUCESTER 
What! threat you me with telling of the king?
Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
I will avouch in presence of the king:
I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Out, devil! I remember them too well:
Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.

GLOUCESTER 
Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
A liberal rewarder of his friends:
To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.

GLOUCESTER 
In all which time you and your husband Grey
Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
What you have been ere now, and what you are;
Withal, what I have been, and what I am.

QUEEN MARGARET 
A murderous villain, and so still thou art.

GLOUCESTER 
Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--

QUEEN MARGARET 
Which God revenge!

GLOUCESTER 
To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
I am too childish-foolish for this world.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.

RIVERS 
My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
So should we you, if you should be our king.

GLOUCESTER 
If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
As little joy may you suppose in me.
That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.

QUEEN MARGARET 
A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
For I am she, and altogether joyless.
I can no longer hold me patient.

Advancing

Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, do not turn away!

GLOUCESTER 
Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?

QUEEN MARGARET 
But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
That will I make before I let thee go.

GLOUCESTER 
Wert thou not banished on pain of death?

QUEEN MARGARET 
I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
Than death can yield me here by my abode.
A husband and a son thou owest to me;
And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.

GLOUCESTER 
The curse my noble father laid on thee,
When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
His curses, then from bitterness of soul
Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
So just is God, to right the innocent.

HASTINGS 
O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!

RIVERS 
Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.

DORSET 
No man but prophesied revenge for it.

BUCKINGHAM 
Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.

QUEEN MARGARET 
What were you snarling all before I came,
Ready to catch each other by the throat,
And turn you all your hatred now on me?
Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
As ours by murder, to make him a king!
Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
And see another, as I see thee now,
Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
Long die thy happy days before thy death;
And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That none of you may live your natural age,
But by some unlook'd accident cut off!

GLOUCESTER 
Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!

QUEEN MARGARET 
And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
If heaven have any grievous plague in store
Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
And then hurl down their indignation
On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
The slave of nature and the son of hell!
Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
Thou rag of honour! thou detested--

GLOUCESTER 
Margaret.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Richard!

GLOUCESTER 
Ha!

QUEEN MARGARET 
I call thee not.

GLOUCESTER 
I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
O, let me make the period to my curse!

GLOUCESTER 
'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.

HASTINGS 
False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.

RIVERS 
Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.

QUEEN MARGARET 
To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!

DORSET 
Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
O, that your young nobility could judge
What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.

GLOUCESTER 
Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.

DORSET 
It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.

GLOUCESTER 
Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.

QUEEN MARGARET 
And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
As it was won with blood, lost be it so!

BUCKINGHAM 
Have done! for shame, if not for charity.

QUEEN MARGARET 
Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
My charity is outrage, life my shame
And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.

BUCKINGHAM 
Have done, have done.

QUEEN MARGARET 
O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
In sign of league and amity with thee:
Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
Nor thou within the compass of my curse.

BUCKINGHAM 
Nor no one here; for curses never pass
The lips of those that breathe them in the air.

QUEEN MARGARET 
I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
Have not to do with him, beware of him;
Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
And all their ministers attend on him.

GLOUCESTER 
What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?

BUCKINGHAM 
Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.

QUEEN MARGARET 
What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
O, but remember this another day,
When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
And he to yours, and all of you to God's!

Exit

HASTINGS 
My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.

RIVERS 
And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.

GLOUCESTER 
I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
My part thereof that I have done to her.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
I never did her any, to my knowledge.

GLOUCESTER 
But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
I was too hot to do somebody good,
That is too cold in thinking of it now.
Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
God pardon them that are the cause of it!

RIVERS 
A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
To pray for them that have done scathe to us.

GLOUCESTER 
So do I ever:

Aside

being well-advised.
For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.

Enter CATESBY

CATESBY 
Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?

RIVERS 
Madam, we will attend your grace.

Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER 
I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
I do beweep to many simple gulls
Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
And say it is the queen and her allies
That stir the king against the duke my brother.
Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
And thus I clothe my naked villany
With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.

Enter two Murderers

But, soft! here come my executioners.
How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
Are you now going to dispatch this deed?

First Murderer 
We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
That we may be admitted where he is.

GLOUCESTER 
Well thought upon; I have it here about me.

Gives the warrant

When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.

First Murderer 
Tush!
Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
Talkers are no good doers: be assured
We come to use our hands and not our tongues.

GLOUCESTER 
Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
I like you, lads; about your business straight;
Go, go, dispatch.

First Murderer 
We will, my noble lord.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. London. The Tower.

Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY 
BRAKENBURY 
Why looks your grace so heavily today?

CLARENCE 
O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!

BRAKENBURY 
What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE 
Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
And cited up a thousand fearful times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster
That had befall'n us. As we paced along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.

BRAKENBURY 
Had you such leisure in the time of death
To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?

CLARENCE 
Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.

BRAKENBURY 
Awaked you not with this sore agony?

CLARENCE 
O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
O, then began the tempest to my soul,
Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked, and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell,
Such terrible impression made the dream.

BRAKENBURY 
No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.

CLARENCE 
O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
Which now bear evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.

BRAKENBURY 
I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!

CLARENCE sleeps

Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
Princes have but their tides for their glories,
An outward honour for an inward toil;
And, for unfelt imagination,
They often feel a world of restless cares:
So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
There's nothing differs but the outward fame.

Enter the two Murderers

First Murderer 
Ho! who's here?

BRAKENBURY 
In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?

First Murderer 
I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.

BRAKENBURY 
Yea, are you so brief?

Second Murderer 
O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
him our commission; talk no more.

BRAKENBURY reads it

BRAKENBURY 
I am, in this, commanded to deliver
The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
I will not reason what is meant hereby,
Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
I'll to the king; and signify to him
That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.

First Murderer 
Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.

Exit BRAKENBURY

Second Murderer 
What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?

First Murderer 
No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.

Second Murderer 
When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
the judgment-day.

First Murderer 
Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.

Second Murderer 
The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
of remorse in me.

First Murderer 
What, art thou afraid?

Second Murderer 
Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.

First Murderer 
I thought thou hadst been resolute.

Second Murderer 
So I am, to let him live.

First Murderer 
Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.

Second Murderer 
I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
would tell twenty.

First Murderer 
How dost thou feel thyself now?

Second Murderer 
'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
within me.

First Murderer 
Remember our reward, when the deed is done.

Second Murderer 
'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.

First Murderer 
Where is thy conscience now?

Second Murderer 
In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.

First Murderer 
So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
thy conscience flies out.

Second Murderer 
Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.

First Murderer 
How if it come to thee again?

Second Murderer 
I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
is turned out of all towns and cities for a
dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
without it.

First Murderer 
'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
not to kill the duke.

Second Murderer 
Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.

First Murderer 
Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
I warrant thee.

Second Murderer 
Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?

First Murderer 
Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
in the next room.

Second Murderer 
O excellent devise! make a sop of him.

First Murderer 
Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?

Second Murderer 
No, first let's reason with him.

CLARENCE 
Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.

Second murderer 
You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.

CLARENCE 
In God's name, what art thou?

Second Murderer 
A man, as you are.

CLARENCE 
But not, as I am, royal.

Second Murderer 
Nor you, as we are, loyal.

CLARENCE 
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.

Second Murderer 
My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.

CLARENCE 
How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?

Both 
To, to, to--

CLARENCE 
To murder me?

Both 
Ay, ay.

CLARENCE 
You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?

First Murderer 
Offended us you have not, but the king.

CLARENCE 
I shall be reconciled to him again.

Second Murderer 
Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.

CLARENCE 
Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
What lawful quest have given their verdict up
Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
Before I be convict by course of law,
To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
That you depart and lay no hands on me
The deed you undertake is damnable.

First Murderer 
What we will do, we do upon command.

Second Murderer 
And he that hath commanded is the king.

CLARENCE 
Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
Hath in the tables of his law commanded
That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
To hurl upon their heads that break his law.

Second Murderer 
And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
For false forswearing and for murder too:
Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.

First Murderer 
And, like a traitor to the name of God,
Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.

Second Murderer 
Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.

First Murderer 
How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?

CLARENCE 
Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
He sends ye not to murder me for this
For in this sin he is as deep as I.
If God will be revenged for this deed.
O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
He needs no indirect nor lawless course
To cut off those that have offended him.

First Murderer 
Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?

CLARENCE 
My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.

First Murderer 
Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE 
Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
I am his brother, and I love him well.
If you be hired for meed, go back again,
And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
Who shall reward you better for my life
Than Edward will for tidings of my death.

Second Murderer 
You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.

CLARENCE 
O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
Go you to him from me.

Both 
Ay, so we will.

CLARENCE 
Tell him, when that our princely father York
Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
And charged us from his soul to love each other,
He little thought of this divided friendship:
Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.

First Murderer 
Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.

CLARENCE 
O, do not slander him, for he is kind.

First Murderer 
Right,
As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.

CLARENCE 
It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
That he would labour my delivery.

Second Murderer 
Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.

First Murderer 
Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.

CLARENCE 
Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
To counsel me to make my peace with God,
And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
To do this deed will hate you for the deed.

Second Murderer 
What shall we do?

CLARENCE 
Relent, and save your souls.

First Murderer 
Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.

CLARENCE 
Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
Would not entreat for life?
My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
As you would beg, were you in my distress
A begging prince what beggar pities not?

Second Murderer 
Look behind you, my lord.

First Murderer 
Take that, and that: if all this will not do,

Stabs him

I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.

Exit, with the body

Second Murderer 
A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
Of this most grievous guilty murder done!

Re-enter First Murderer

First Murderer 
How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!

Second Murderer 
I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
For I repent me that the duke is slain.

Exit

First Murderer 
So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
Now must I hide his body in some hole,
Until the duke take order for his burial:
And when I have my meed, I must away;
For this will out, and here I must not stay.


ACT II
SCENE I. London. The palace.

Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others 
KING EDWARD IV 
Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
You peers, continue this united league:
I every day expect an embassage
From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.

RIVERS 
By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.

HASTINGS 
So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!

KING EDWARD IV 
Take heed you dally not before your king;
Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
Either of you to be the other's end.

HASTINGS 
So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!

RIVERS 
And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!

KING EDWARD IV 
Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
You have been factious one against the other,
Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
And what you do, do it unfeignedly.

QUEEN ELIZABETH 
Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!

KING EDWARD IV 
Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.

DORSET 
This interchange of love, I here protest,
Upon my part shall be unviolable.

HASTINGS 
And so swear I, my lord

They embrace

KING EDWARD IV 
Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
And make me happy in your unity.

BUCKINGHAM 
Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
On you or yours,

To the Queen

but with all duteous love
Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
With hate in those where I expect most love!
When I have most need to employ a friend,
And most assured that he is a friend
