The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
Whose beauty did astonish the survey
Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
Humbly call'd mistress.

KING 
Praising what is lost
Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
The nature of his great offence is dead,
And deeper than oblivion we do bury
The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
A stranger, no offender; and inform him
So 'tis our will he should.

Gentleman 
I shall, my liege.

Exit

KING 
What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?

LAFEU 
All that he is hath reference to your highness.

KING 
Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
That set him high in fame.

Enter BERTRAM

LAFEU 
He looks well on't.

KING 
I am not a day of season,
For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
In me at once: but to the brightest beams
Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
The time is fair again.

BERTRAM 
My high-repented blames,
Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

KING 
All is whole;
Not one word more of the consumed time.
Let's take the instant by the forward top;
For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
The daughter of this lord?

BERTRAM 
Admiringly, my liege, at first
I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
Extended or contracted all proportions
To a most hideous object: thence it came
That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
The dust that did offend it.

KING 
Well excused:
That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
To the great sender turns a sour offence,
Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
Make trivial price of serious things we have,
Not knowing them until we know their grave:
Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
To see our widower's second marriage-day.

COUNTESS 
Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

LAFEU 
Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
Must be digested, give a favour from you
To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
That she may quickly come.

BERTRAM gives a ring

By my old beard,
And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
The last that e'er I took her at court,
I saw upon her finger.

BERTRAM 
Hers it was not.

KING 
Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
Necessitied to help, that by this token
I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
her
Of what should stead her most?

BERTRAM 
My gracious sovereign,
Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
The ring was never hers.

COUNTESS 
Son, on my life,
I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
At her life's rate.

LAFEU 
I am sure I saw her wear it.

BERTRAM 
You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
I could not answer in that course of honour
As she had made the overture, she ceased
In heavy satisfaction and would never
Receive the ring again.

KING 
Plutus himself,
That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
Hath not in nature's mystery more science
Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
That you are well acquainted with yourself,
Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
That she would never put it from her finger,
Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
Where you have never come, or sent it us
Upon her great disaster.

BERTRAM 
She never saw it.

KING 
Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
And makest conjectural fears to come into me
Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
More than to see this ring. Take him away.

Guards seize BERTRAM

My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
We'll sift this matter further.

BERTRAM 
If you shall prove
This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
Where yet she never was.

Exit, guarded

KING 
I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

Enter a Gentleman

Gentleman 
Gracious sovereign,
Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
Here's a petition from a Florentine,
Who hath for four or five removes come short
To tender it herself. I undertook it,
Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
Is here attending: her business looks in her
With an importing visage; and she told me,
In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
Your highness with herself.

KING 
[Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me
when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
DIANA CAPILET.

LAFEU 
I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
this: I'll none of him.

KING 
The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
Go speedily and bring again the count.
I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
Was foully snatch'd.

COUNTESS 
Now, justice on the doers!

Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded

KING 
I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
Yet you desire to marry.

Enter Widow and DIANA

What woman's that?

DIANA 
I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
Derived from the ancient Capilet:
My suit, as I do understand, you know,
And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

Widow 
I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
And both shall cease, without your remedy.

KING 
Come hither, count; do you know these women?

BERTRAM 
My lord, I neither can nor will deny
But that I know them: do they charge me further?

DIANA 
Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

BERTRAM 
She's none of mine, my lord.

DIANA 
If you shall marry,
You give away this hand, and that is mine;
You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
You give away myself, which is known mine;
For I by vow am so embodied yours,
That she which marries you must marry me,
Either both or none.

LAFEU 
Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
are no husband for her.

BERTRAM 
My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
Than for to think that I would sink it here.

KING 
Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
Than in my thought it lies.

DIANA 
Good my lord,
Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
He had not my virginity.

KING 
What say'st thou to her?

BERTRAM 
She's impudent, my lord,
And was a common gamester to the camp.

DIANA 
He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
He might have bought me at a common price:
Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
Whose high respect and rich validity
Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
If I be one.

COUNTESS 
He blushes, and 'tis it:
Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
That ring's a thousand proofs.

KING 
Methought you said
You saw one here in court could witness it.

DIANA 
I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

LAFEU 
I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

KING 
Find him, and bring him hither.

Exit an Attendant

BERTRAM 
What of him?
He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
That will speak any thing?

KING 
She hath that ring of yours.

BERTRAM 
I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
She knew her distance and did angle for me,
Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
As all impediments in fancy's course
Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
And I had that which any inferior might
At market-price have bought.

DIANA 
I must be patient:
You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
Send for your ring, I will return it home,
And give me mine again.

BERTRAM 
I have it not.

KING 
What ring was yours, I pray you?

DIANA 
Sir, much like
The same upon your finger.

KING 
Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

DIANA 
And this was it I gave him, being abed.

KING 
The story then goes false, you threw it him
Out of a casement.

DIANA 
I have spoke the truth.

Enter PAROLLES

BERTRAM 
My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

KING 
You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
Is this the man you speak of?

DIANA 
Ay, my lord.

KING 
Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
By him and by this woman here what know you?

PAROLLES 
So please your majesty, my master hath been an
honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
which gentlemen have.

KING 
Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

PAROLLES 
Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

KING 
How, I pray you?

PAROLLES 
He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

KING 
How is that?

PAROLLES 
He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

KING 
As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
equivocal companion is this!

PAROLLES 
I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

LAFEU 
He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

DIANA 
Do you know he promised me marriage?

PAROLLES 
Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

KING 
But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

PAROLLES 
Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
was in that credit with them at that time that I
knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
as promising her marriage, and things which would
derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
speak what I know.

KING 
Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
evidence; therefore stand aside.
This ring, you say, was yours?

DIANA 
Ay, my good lord.

KING 
Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

DIANA 
It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

KING 
Who lent it you?

DIANA 
It was not lent me neither.

KING 
Where did you find it, then?

DIANA 
I found it not.

KING 
If it were yours by none of all these ways,
How could you give it him?

DIANA 
I never gave it him.

LAFEU 
This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
and on at pleasure.

KING 
This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

DIANA 
It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

KING 
Take her away; I do not like her now;
To prison with her: and away with him.
Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
Thou diest within this hour.

DIANA 
I'll never tell you.

KING 
Take her away.

DIANA 
I'll put in bail, my liege.

KING 
I think thee now some common customer.

DIANA 
By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

KING 
Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

DIANA 
Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

KING 
She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

DIANA 
Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

Exit Widow

The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
And at that time he got his wife with child:
Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
And now behold the meaning.

Re-enter Widow, with HELENA

KING 
Is there no exorcist
Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
Is't real that I see?

HELENA 
No, my good lord;
'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
The name and not the thing.

BERTRAM 
Both, both. O, pardon!

HELENA 
O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
'When from my finger you can get this ring
And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:
Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

BERTRAM 
If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

HELENA 
If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
Deadly divorce step between me and you!
O my dear mother, do I see you living?

LAFEU 
Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

To PAROLLES

Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

KING 
Let us from point to point this story know,
To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

To DIANA

If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
For I can guess that by thy honest aid
Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
Of that and all the progress, more or less,
Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

Flourish

EPILOGUE

KING 
The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
All is well ended, if this suit be won,
That you express content; which we will pay,
With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

ACT I
SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.

Enter ORLANDO and ADAM 
ORLANDO 
As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
which his animals on his dunghills are as much
bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

ADAM 
Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ORLANDO 
Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
shake me up.

Enter OLIVER

OLIVER 
Now, sir! what make you here?

ORLANDO 
Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.

OLIVER 
What mar you then, sir?

ORLANDO 
Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

OLIVER 
Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

ORLANDO 
Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
come to such penury?

OLIVER 
Know you where your are, sir?

ORLANDO 
O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.

OLIVER 
Know you before whom, sir?

ORLANDO 
Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
condition of blood, you should so know me. The
courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
you are the first-born; but the same tradition
takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
nearer to his reverence.

OLIVER 
What, boy!

ORLANDO 
Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

OLIVER 
Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

ORLANDO 
I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
a villain that says such a father begot villains.
Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.

ADAM 
Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
remembrance, be at accord.

OLIVER 
Let me go, I say.

ORLANDO 
I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
father charged you in his will to give me good
education: you have trained me like a peasant,
obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
give me the poor allottery my father left me by
testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.

OLIVER 
And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
pray you, leave me.

ORLANDO 
I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

OLIVER 
Get you with him, you old dog.

ADAM 
Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
he would not have spoke such a word.

Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER 
Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!

Enter DENNIS

DENNIS 
Calls your worship?

OLIVER 
Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

DENNIS 
So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
access to you.

OLIVER 
Call him in.

Exit DENNIS

'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.

Enter CHARLES

CHARLES 
Good morrow to your worship.

OLIVER 
Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
new court?

CHARLES 
There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

OLIVER 
Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
banished with her father?

CHARLES 
O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
that she would have followed her exile, or have died
to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
never two ladies loved as they do.

OLIVER 
Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES 
They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
a many merry men with him; and there they live like
the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

OLIVER 
What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

CHARLES 
Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
withal, that either you might stay him from his
intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
and altogether against my will.

OLIVER 
Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
me his natural brother: therefore use thy
discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
treacherous device and never leave thee till he
hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES 
I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
so God keep your worship!

OLIVER 
Farewell, good Charles.

Exit CHARLES

Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
people, who best know him, that I am altogether
misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

Exit

SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.

Enter CELIA and ROSALIND 
CELIA 
I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND 
Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA 
Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
tempered as mine is to thee.

ROSALIND 
Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
rejoice in yours.

CELIA 
You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
father perforce, I will render thee again in
affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

ROSALIND 
From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
me see; what think you of falling in love?

CELIA 
Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
in honour come off again.

ROSALIND 
What shall be our sport, then?

CELIA 
Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

ROSALIND 
I would we could do so, for her benefits are
mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

CELIA 
'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
makes very ill-favouredly.

ROSALIND 
Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
not in the lineaments of Nature.

Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA 
No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND 
Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
Nature's wit.

CELIA 
Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
wit! whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE 
Mistress, you must come away to your father.

CELIA 
Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE 
No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

ROSALIND 
Where learned you that oath, fool?

TOUCHSTONE 
Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
yet was not the knight forsworn.

CELIA 
How prove you that, in the great heap of your
knowledge?

ROSALIND 
Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

TOUCHSTONE 
Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA 
By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE 
By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

CELIA 
Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE 
One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

CELIA 
My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
one of these days.

TOUCHSTONE 
The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
wise men do foolishly.

CELIA 
By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
Monsieur Le Beau.

ROSALIND 
With his mouth full of news.

CELIA 
Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.

ROSALIND 
Then shall we be news-crammed.

CELIA 
All the better; we shall be the more marketable.

Enter LE BEAU

Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?

LE BEAU 
Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

CELIA 
Sport! of what colour?

LE BEAU 
What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND 
As wit and fortune will.

TOUCHSTONE 
Or as the Destinies decree.

CELIA 
Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

TOUCHSTONE 
Nay, if I keep not my rank,--

ROSALIND 
Thou losest thy old smell.

LE BEAU 
You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

ROSALIND 
You tell us the manner of the wrestling.

LE BEAU 
I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
to perform it.

CELIA 
Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

LE BEAU 
There comes an old man and his three sons,--

CELIA 
I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU 
Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND 
With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
by these presents.'

LE BEAU 
The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
their father, making such pitiful dole over them
that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

ROSALIND 
Alas!

TOUCHSTONE 
But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
have lost?

LE BEAU 
Why, this that I speak of.

TOUCHSTONE 
Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
for ladies.

CELIA 
Or I, I promise thee.

ROSALIND 
But is there any else longs to see this broken music
in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

LE BEAU 
You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
perform it.

CELIA 
Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants

DUKE FREDERICK 
Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
own peril on his forwardness.

ROSALIND 
Is yonder the man?

LE BEAU 
Even he, madam.

CELIA 
Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.

DUKE FREDERICK 
How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
to see the wrestling?

ROSALIND 
Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.

DUKE FREDERICK 
You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
you can move him.

CELIA 
Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Do so: I'll not be by.

LE BEAU 
Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.

ORLANDO 
I attend them with all respect and duty.

ROSALIND 
Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO 
No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
come but in, as others do, to try with him the
strength of my youth.

CELIA 
Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
adventure would counsel you to a more equal
enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

ROSALIND 
Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
that the wrestling might not go forward.

ORLANDO 
I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
the world I fill up a place, which may be better
supplied when I have made it empty.

ROSALIND 
The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.

CELIA 
And mine, to eke out hers.

ROSALIND 
Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!

CELIA 
Your heart's desires be with you!

CHARLES 
Come, where is this young gallant that is so
desirous to lie with his mother earth?

ORLANDO 
Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.

DUKE FREDERICK 
You shall try but one fall.

CHARLES 
No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
from a first.

ORLANDO 
An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
mocked me before: but come your ways.

ROSALIND 
Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

CELIA 
I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
fellow by the leg.

They wrestle

ROSALIND 
O excellent young man!

CELIA 
If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
should down.

Shout. CHARLES is thrown

DUKE FREDERICK 
No more, no more.

ORLANDO 
Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.

DUKE FREDERICK 
How dost thou, Charles?

LE BEAU 
He cannot speak, my lord.

DUKE FREDERICK 
Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?

ORLANDO 
Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

DUKE FREDERICK 
I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
But I did find him still mine enemy:
Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
Hadst thou descended from another house.
But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
I would thou hadst told me of another father.

Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU

CELIA 
Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

ORLANDO 
I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
To be adopted heir to Frederick.

ROSALIND 
My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
And all the world was of my father's mind:
Had I before known this young man his son,
I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
Ere he should thus have ventured.

CELIA 
Gentle cousin,
Let us go thank him and encourage him:
My father's rough and envious disposition
Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
If you do keep your promises in love
But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
Your mistress shall be happy.

ROSALIND 
Gentleman,

Giving him a chain from her neck

Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
Shall we go, coz?

CELIA 
Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.

ORLANDO 
Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

ROSALIND 
He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
More than your enemies.

CELIA 
Will you go, coz?

ROSALIND 
Have with you. Fare you well.

Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

ORLANDO 
What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.

Re-enter LE BEAU

LE BEAU 
Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
High commendation, true applause and love,
Yet such is now the duke's condition
That he misconstrues all that you have done.
The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.

ORLANDO 
I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
Which of the two was daughter of the duke
That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU 
Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
To keep his daughter company; whose loves
Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
But I can tell you that of late this duke
Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
Grounded upon no other argument
But that the people praise her for her virtues
And pity her for her good father's sake;
And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
Hereafter, in a better world than this,
I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

ORLANDO 
I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

Exit LE BEAU

Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
But heavenly Rosalind!

Exit

SCENE III. A room in the palace.

Enter CELIA and ROSALIND 
CELIA 
Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?

ROSALIND 
Not one to throw at a dog.

CELIA 
No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.

ROSALIND 
Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
without any.

CELIA 
But is all this for your father?

ROSALIND 
No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
full of briers is this working-day world!

CELIA 
They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
paths our very petticoats will catch them.

ROSALIND 
I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.

CELIA 
Hem them away.

ROSALIND 
I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.

CELIA 
Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

ROSALIND 
O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!

CELIA 
O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

ROSALIND 
The duke my father loved his father dearly.

CELIA 
Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
not Orlando.
