MARK ANTONY 
These quick-sands, Lepidus,
Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS 
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY 
What say'st thou?

MENAS 
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY 
How should that be?

MENAS 
But entertain it,
And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY 
Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS 
Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY 
Show me which way.

MENAS 
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
All there is thine.

POMPEY 
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done;
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS 
[Aside] For this,
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
Shall never find it more.

POMPEY 
This health to Lepidus!

MARK ANTONY 
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS 
Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY 
Fill till the cup be hid.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS

MENAS 
Why?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
not?

MENAS 
The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
That it might go on wheels!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS 
Come.

POMPEY 
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

MARK ANTONY 
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
Here is to Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
And it grows fouler.

MARK ANTONY 
Be a child o' the time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Possess it, I'll make answer:
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ha, my brave emperor!

To MARK ANTONY

Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY 
Let's ha't, good soldier.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, let's all take hands,
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.

Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand

THE SONG.
Come, thou monarch of the vine,
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
Cup us, till the world go round,
Cup us, till the world go round!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
Let me request you off: our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY 
I'll try you on the shore.

MARK ANTONY 
And shall, sir; give's your hand.

POMPEY 
O Antony,
You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
Come, down into the boat.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Take heed you fall not.

Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS

Menas, I'll not on shore.

MENAS 
No, to my cabin.
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!

Sound a flourish, with drums

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ho! says a' There's my cap.

MENAS 
Ho! Noble captain, come.

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.

Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him 
VENTIDIUS 
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS 
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS 
O Silius, Silius,
I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
Better to leave undone, than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person: Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.

SILIUS 
Thou hast, Ventidius,
that
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!

VENTIDIUS 
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' the field.

SILIUS 
Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS 
He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with's will permit,
We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!

Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another 
AGRIPPA 
What, are the brothers parted?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA 
'Tis a noble Lepidus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA 
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA 
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

AGRIPPA 
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.

AGRIPPA 
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA 
Both he loves.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
They are his shards, and he their beetle.

Trumpets within

So;
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA 
Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY 
No further, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.

MARK ANTONY 
Make me not offended
In your distrust.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I have said.

MARK ANTONY 
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
The elements be kind to thee, and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.

OCTAVIA 
My noble brother!

MARK ANTONY 
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

OCTAVIA 
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA 
I'll tell you in your ear.

MARK ANTONY 
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
down-feather,
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
And neither way inclines.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't, till I wept too.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Adieu; be happy!

LEPIDUS 
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Farewell, fa rewell!

Kisses OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY 
Farewell!

Trumpets sound. Exeunt

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS 
CLEOPATRA 
Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS 
Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA 
Go to, go to.

Enter the Messenger as before

Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS 
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.

CLEOPATRA 
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

Messenger 
Most gracious majesty,--

CLEOPATRA 
Didst thou behold Octavia?

Messenger 
Ay, dread queen.

CLEOPATRA 
Where?

Messenger 
Madam, in Rome;
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA 
Is she as tall as me?

Messenger 
She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

Messenger 
Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.

CLEOPATRA 
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN 
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA 
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

Messenger 
She creeps:
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA 
Is this certain?

Messenger 
Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN 
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA 
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN 
Excellent.

CLEOPATRA 
Guess at her years, I prithee.

Messenger 
Madam,
She was a widow,--

CLEOPATRA 
Widow! Charmian, hark.

Messenger 
And I do think she's thirty.

CLEOPATRA 
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?

Messenger 
Round even to faultiness.

CLEOPATRA 
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?

Messenger 
Brown, madam: and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.

CLEOPATRA 
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.

Exit Messenger

CHARMIAN 
A proper man.

CLEOPATRA 
Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN 
Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN 
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA 
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN 
I warrant you, madam.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.

Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA 
MARK ANTONY 
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
That were excusable, that, and thousands more
Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
To public ear:
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
Or did it from his teeth.

OCTAVIA 
O my good lord,
Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
Praying for both parts:
The good gods me presently,
When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
'Twixt these extremes at all.

MARK ANTONY 
Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
I lose myself: better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
I'll raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
So your desires are yours.

OCTAVIA 
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
Should solder up the rift.

MARK ANTONY 
When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
Can never be so equal, that your love
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
Choose your own company, and command what cost
Your heart has mind to.

Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. Another room.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting 
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
How now, friend Eros!

EROS 
There's strange news come, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What, man?

EROS 
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
This is old: what is the success?

EROS 
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
him partake in the glory of the action: and not
resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS 
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murder'd Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS 
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
My lord desires you presently: my news
I might have told hereafter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
'Twill be naught:
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS 
Come, sir.

Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute queen.

MECAENAS 
This in the public eye?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
As 'tis reported, so.

MECAENAS 
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.

AGRIPPA 
Who, queasy with his insolence
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
The people know it; and have now received
His accusations.

AGRIPPA 
Who does he accuse?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.

AGRIPPA 
Sir, this should be answer'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
That he his high authority abused,
And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
Demand the like.

MECAENAS 
He'll never yield to that.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

Enter OCTAVIA with her train

OCTAVIA 
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
That ever I should call thee castaway!

OCTAVIA 
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
Is often left unloved; we should have met you
By sea and land; supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA 
Good my lord,
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
His pardon for return.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Which soon he granted,
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA 
Do not say so, my lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?

OCTAVIA 
My lord, in Athens.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore; who now are levying
The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
With a more larger list of sceptres.

OCTAVIA 
Ay me, most wretched,
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
That do afflict each other!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Welcome hither:
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
O'er your content these strong necessities;
But let determined things to destiny
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
To do you justice, make them ministers
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA 
Welcome, lady.

MECAENAS 
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
Only the adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off;
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA 
Is it so, sir?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!

Exeunt

SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.

Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
CLEOPATRA 
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But why, why, why?

CLEOPATRA 
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
And say'st it is not fit.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA 
If not denounced against us, why should not we
Be there in person?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] Well, I could reply:
If we should serve with horse and mares together,
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
A soldier and his horse.

CLEOPATRA 
What is't you say?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart, take from his brain,
from's time,
What should not then be spared. He is already
Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.

CLEOPATRA 
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
I will not stay behind.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Nay, I have done.
Here comes the emperor.

Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS

MARK ANTONY 
Is it not strange, Canidius,
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?

CLEOPATRA 
Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent.

MARK ANTONY 
A good rebuke,
Which might have well becomed the best of men,
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
Will fight with him by sea.

CLEOPATRA 
By sea! what else?

CANIDIUS 
Why will my lord do so?

MARK ANTONY 
For that he dares us to't.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

CANIDIUS 
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
And so should you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepared for land.

MARK ANTONY 
By sea, by sea.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army, which doth most consist
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
From firm security.

MARK ANTONY 
I'll fight at sea.

CLEOPATRA 
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

MARK ANTONY 
Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
We then can do't at land.

Enter a Messenger

Thy business?

Messenger 
The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
Caesar has taken Toryne.

MARK ANTONY 
Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
Strange that power should be. Canidius,
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
Away, my Thetis!

Enter a Soldier

How now, worthy soldier?

Soldier 
O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
And fighting foot to foot.

MARK ANTONY 
Well, well: away!

Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Soldier 
By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.

CANIDIUS 
Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
And we are women's men.

Soldier 
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

CANIDIUS 
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.

Soldier 
While he was yet in Rome,
His power went out in such distractions as
Beguiled all spies.

CANIDIUS 
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

Soldier 
They say, one Taurus.

CANIDIUS 
Well I know the man.

Enter a Messenger

Messenger 
The emperor calls Canidius.

CANIDIUS 
With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
Each minute, some.

Exeunt

SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Taurus!

TAURUS 
My lord?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
Upon this jump.

Exeunt

SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.

Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
MARK ANTONY 
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,
In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
We may the number of the ships behold,
And so proceed accordingly.

Exeunt

SCENE X. Another part of the plain.

CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight 

Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
To see't mine eyes are blasted.

Enter SCARUS

SCARUS 
Gods and goddesses,
All the whole synod of them!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What's thy passion!

SCARUS 
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
How appears the fight?

SCARUS 
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sails and flies.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
That I beheld:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
Endure a further view.

SCARUS 
She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Alack, alack!

Enter CANIDIUS

CANIDIUS 
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
O, he has given example for our flight,
Most grossly, by his own!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why, then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS 
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

SCARUS 
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
What further comes.

CANIDIUS 
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse: six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
Sits in the wind against me.

Exeunt

SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants 
MARK ANTONY 
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
I am so lated in the world, that I
Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
And make your peace with Caesar.

All 
Fly! not we.

MARK ANTONY 
I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
I have myself resolved upon a course
Which has no need of you; be gone:
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.

Sits down

Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following

EROS 
Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

IRAS 
Do, most dear queen.

CHARMIAN 
Do! why: what else?

CLEOPATRA 
Let me sit down. O Juno!

MARK ANTONY 
No, no, no, no, no.

EROS 
See you here, sir?

MARK ANTONY 
O fie, fie, fie!

CHARMIAN 
Madam!

IRAS 
Madam, O good empress!

EROS 
Sir, sir,--

MARK ANTONY 
Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.

CLEOPATRA 
Ah, stand by.

EROS 
The queen, my lord, the queen.

IRAS 
Go to him, madam, speak to him:
He is unqualitied with very shame.

CLEOPATRA 
Well then, sustain him: O!

EROS 
Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
Your comfort makes the rescue.

MARK ANTONY 
I have offended reputation,
A most unnoble swerving.

EROS 
Sir, the queen.

MARK ANTONY 
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
By looking back what I have left behind
'Stroy'd in dishonour.

CLEOPATRA 
O my lord, my lord,
Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
You would have follow'd.

MARK ANTONY 
Egypt, thou knew'st too well
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
Command me.

CLEOPATRA 
O, my pardon!

MARK ANTONY 
Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
Making and marring fortunes. You did know
How much you were my conqueror; and that
My sword, made weak by my affection, would
Obey it on all cause.

CLEOPATRA 
Pardon, pardon!

MARK ANTONY 
Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

Exeunt

SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
Know you him?

DOLABELLA 
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.

Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Approach, and speak.

EUPHRONIUS 
Such as I am, I come from Antony:
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
To his grand sea.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Be't so: declare thine office.

EUPHRONIUS 
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
A private man in Athens: this for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
Now hazarded to thy grace.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
For Antony,
I have no ears to his request. The queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
Or take his life there: this if she perform,
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

EUPHRONIUS 
Fortune pursue thee!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Bring him through the bands.

Exit EUPHRONIUS

To THYREUS

From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
And in our name, what she requires; add more,
From thine invention, offers: women are not
In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
Will answer as a law.

THYREUS 
Caesar, I go.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
In every power that moves.

THYREUS 
Caesar, I shall.

Exeunt

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS 
CLEOPATRA 
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA 
Is Antony or we in fault for this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
When half to half the world opposed, he being
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA 
Prithee, peace.

Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador

MARK ANTONY 
Is that his answer?

EUPHRONIUS 
Ay, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up.

EUPHRONIUS 
He says so.

MARK ANTONY 
Let her know't.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.

CLEOPATRA 
That head, my lord?

MARK ANTONY 
To him again: tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart,
And answer me declined, sword against sword,
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.

Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
