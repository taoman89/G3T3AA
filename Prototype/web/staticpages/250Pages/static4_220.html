I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
as lief have been myself alone.

ORLANDO 
And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
too for your society.

JAQUES 
God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.

ORLANDO 
I do desire we may be better strangers.

JAQUES 
I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
love-songs in their barks.

ORLANDO 
I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
them ill-favouredly.

JAQUES 
Rosalind is your love's name?

ORLANDO 
Yes, just.

JAQUES 
I do not like her name.

ORLANDO 
There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
christened.

JAQUES 
What stature is she of?

ORLANDO 
Just as high as my heart.

JAQUES 
You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
out of rings?

ORLANDO 
Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
whence you have studied your questions.

JAQUES 
You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
we two will rail against our mistress the world and
all our misery.

ORLANDO 
I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
against whom I know most faults.

JAQUES 
The worst fault you have is to be in love.

ORLANDO 
'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
I am weary of you.

JAQUES 
By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
you.

ORLANDO 
He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
shall see him.

JAQUES 
There I shall see mine own figure.

ORLANDO 
Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.

JAQUES 
I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
Signior Love.

ORLANDO 
I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
Melancholy.

Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND 
[Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy
lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
Do you hear, forester?

ORLANDO 
Very well: what would you?

ROSALIND 
I pray you, what is't o'clock?

ORLANDO 
You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
in the forest.

ROSALIND 
Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.

ORLANDO 
And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
been as proper?

ROSALIND 
By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
withal and who he stands still withal.

ORLANDO 
I prithee, who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND 
Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
contract of her marriage and the day it is
solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
seven year.

ORLANDO 
Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND 
With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.

ORLANDO 
Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND 
With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.

ORLANDO 
Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND 
With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.

ORLANDO 
Where dwell you, pretty youth?

ROSALIND 
With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.

ORLANDO 
Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND 
As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.

ORLANDO 
Your accent is something finer than you could
purchase in so removed a dwelling.

ROSALIND 
I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
whole sex withal.

ORLANDO 
Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
laid to the charge of women?

ROSALIND 
There were none principal; they were all like one
another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.

ORLANDO 
I prithee, recount some of them.

ROSALIND 
No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
quotidian of love upon him.

ORLANDO 
I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
your remedy.

ROSALIND 
There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.

ORLANDO 
What were his marks?

ROSALIND 
A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.

ORLANDO 
Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.

ROSALIND 
Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
do than to confess she does: that is one of the
points in the which women still give the lie to
their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
is so admired?

ORLANDO 
I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.

ROSALIND 
But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

ORLANDO 
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

ROSALIND 
Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
the reason why they are not so punished and cured
is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

ORLANDO 
Did you ever cure any so?

ROSALIND 
Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
passion something and for no passion truly any
thing, as boys and women are for the most part
cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.

ORLANDO 
I would not be cured, youth.

ROSALIND 
I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
and come every day to my cote and woo me.

ORLANDO 
Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
where it is.

ROSALIND 
Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
Will you go?

ORLANDO 
With all my heart, good youth.

ROSALIND 
Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

Exeunt

SCENE III. The forest.

Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind 
TOUCHSTONE 
Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
doth my simple feature content you?

AUDREY 
Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!

TOUCHSTONE 
I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.

JAQUES 
[Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
in a thatched house!

TOUCHSTONE 
When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
man's good wit seconded with the forward child
Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
the gods had made thee poetical.

AUDREY 
I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE 
No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.

AUDREY 
Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE 
I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
hope thou didst feign.

AUDREY 
Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE 
No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

JAQUES 
[Aside] A material fool!

AUDREY 
Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
make me honest.

TOUCHSTONE 
Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
were to put good meat into an unclean dish.

AUDREY 
I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.

TOUCHSTONE 
Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
of the forest and to couple us.

JAQUES 
[Aside] I would fain see this meeting.

AUDREY 
Well, the gods give us joy!

TOUCHSTONE 
Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
want. Here comes Sir Oliver.

Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
with you to your chapel?

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT 
Is there none here to give the woman?

TOUCHSTONE 
I will not take her on gift of any man.

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT 
Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.

JAQUES 
[Advancing]
Proceed, proceed I'll give her.

TOUCHSTONE 
Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.

JAQUES 
Will you be married, motley?

TOUCHSTONE 
As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.

JAQUES 
And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
church, and have a good priest that can tell you
what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.

TOUCHSTONE 
[Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
married of him than of another: for he is not like
to marry me well; and not being well married, it
will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.

JAQUES 
Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

TOUCHSTONE 
'Come, sweet Audrey:
We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
O sweet Oliver,
O brave Oliver,
Leave me not behind thee: but,--
Wind away,
Begone, I say,
I will not to wedding with thee.

Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT 
'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
all shall flout me out of my calling.

Exit

SCENE IV. The forest.

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA 
ROSALIND 
Never talk to me; I will weep.

CELIA 
Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
that tears do not become a man.

ROSALIND 
But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA 
As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.

ROSALIND 
His very hair is of the dissembling colour.

CELIA 
Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
Judas's own children.

ROSALIND 
I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.

CELIA 
An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.

ROSALIND 
And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
of holy bread.

CELIA 
He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
the very ice of chastity is in them.

ROSALIND 
But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
comes not?

CELIA 
Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

ROSALIND 
Do you think so?

CELIA 
Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
worm-eaten nut.

ROSALIND 
Not true in love?

CELIA 
Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.

ROSALIND 
You have heard him swear downright he was.

CELIA 
'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
here in the forest on the duke your father.

ROSALIND 
I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
man as Orlando?

CELIA 
O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
guides. Who comes here?

Enter CORIN

CORIN 
Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
That was his mistress.

CELIA 
Well, and what of him?

CORIN 
If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
Between the pale complexion of true love
And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
If you will mark it.

ROSALIND 
O, come, let us remove:
The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
I'll prove a busy actor in their play.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the forest.

Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE 
SILVIUS 
Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
Say that you love me not, but say not so
In bitterness. The common executioner,
Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind

PHEBE 
I would not be thy executioner:
I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
The cicatrice and capable impressure
Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
That can do hurt.

SILVIUS 
O dear Phebe,
If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
Then shall you know the wounds invisible
That love's keen arrows make.

PHEBE 
But till that time
Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
As till that time I shall not pity thee.

ROSALIND 
And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
That you insult, exult, and all at once,
Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
As, by my faith, I see no more in you
Than without candle may go dark to bed--
Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
I see no more in you than in the ordinary
Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
That can entame my spirits to your worship.
You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
You are a thousand times a properer man
Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
And out of you she sees herself more proper
Than any of her lineaments can show her.
But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.

PHEBE 
Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

ROSALIND 
He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE 
For no ill will I bear you.

ROSALIND 
I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
For I am falser than vows made in wine:
Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
And be not proud: though all the world could see,
None could be so abused in sight as he.
Come, to our flock.

Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE 
Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'

SILVIUS 
Sweet Phebe,--

PHEBE 
Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS 
Sweet Phebe, pity me.

PHEBE 
Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

SILVIUS 
Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
By giving love your sorrow and my grief
Were both extermined.

PHEBE 
Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS 
I would have you.

PHEBE 
Why, that were covetousness.
Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
But do not look for further recompense
Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

SILVIUS 
So holy and so perfect is my love,
And I in such a poverty of grace,
That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
To glean the broken ears after the man
That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.

PHEBE 
Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS 
Not very well, but I have met him oft;
And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
That the old carlot once was master of.

PHEBE 
Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
But what care I for words? yet words do well
When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
There was a pretty redness in his lip,
A little riper and more lusty red
Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
Between the constant red and mingled damask.
There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
In parcels as I did, would have gone near
To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
For what had he to do to chide at me?
He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
I marvel why I answer'd not again:
But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS 
Phebe, with all my heart.

PHEBE 
I'll write it straight;
The matter's in my head and in my heart:
I will be bitter with him and passing short.
Go with me, Silvius.

Exeunt


ACT IV
SCENE I. The forest.

Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES 
JAQUES 
I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
with thee.

ROSALIND 
They say you are a melancholy fellow.

JAQUES 
I am so; I do love it better than laughing.

ROSALIND 
Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
fellows and betray themselves to every modern
censure worse than drunkards.

JAQUES 
Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.

ROSALIND 
Why then, 'tis good to be a post.

JAQUES 
I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
contemplation of my travels, in which my often
rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.

ROSALIND 
A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.

JAQUES 
Yes, I have gained my experience.

ROSALIND 
And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
sad; and to travel for it too!

Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO 
Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!

JAQUES 
Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.

Exit

ROSALIND 
Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
own country, be out of love with your nativity and
almost chide God for making you that countenance you
are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
another trick, never come in my sight more.

ORLANDO 
My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.

ROSALIND 
Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
him heart-whole.

ORLANDO 
Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

ROSALIND 
Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
had as lief be wooed of a snail.

ORLANDO 
Of a snail?

ROSALIND 
Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
his destiny with him.

ORLANDO 
What's that?

ROSALIND 
Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.

ORLANDO 
Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.

ROSALIND 
And I am your Rosalind.

CELIA 
It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
Rosalind of a better leer than you.

ROSALIND 
Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
humour and like enough to consent. What would you
say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO 
I would kiss before I spoke.

ROSALIND 
Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

ORLANDO 
How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND 
Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.

ORLANDO 
Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND 
Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.

ORLANDO 
What, of my suit?

ROSALIND 
Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO 
I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
talking of her.

ROSALIND 
Well in her person I say I will not have you.

ORLANDO 
Then in mine own person I die.

ROSALIND 
No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
there was not any man died in his own person,
videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
But these are all lies: men have died from time to
time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.

ORLANDO 
I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
for, I protest, her frown might kill me.

ROSALIND 
By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
it.

ORLANDO 
Then love me, Rosalind.

ROSALIND 
Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.

ORLANDO 
And wilt thou have me?

ROSALIND 
Ay, and twenty such.

ORLANDO 
What sayest thou?

ROSALIND 
Are you not good?

ORLANDO 
I hope so.

ROSALIND 
Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?

ORLANDO 
Pray thee, marry us.

CELIA 
I cannot say the words.

ROSALIND 
You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'

CELIA 
Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?

ORLANDO 
I will.

ROSALIND 
Ay, but when?

ORLANDO 
Why now; as fast as she can marry us.

ROSALIND 
Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'

ORLANDO 
I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

ROSALIND 
I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
runs before her actions.

ORLANDO 
So do all thoughts; they are winged.

ROSALIND 
Now tell me how long you would have her after you
have possessed her.

ORLANDO 
For ever and a day.

ROSALIND 
Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
that when thou art inclined to sleep.

ORLANDO 
But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND 
By my life, she will do as I do.

ORLANDO 
O, but she is wise.

ROSALIND 
Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
with the smoke out at the chimney.

ORLANDO 
A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
'Wit, whither wilt?'

ROSALIND 
Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.

ORLANDO 
And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

ROSALIND 
Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
never take her without her answer, unless you take
her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
it like a fool!

ORLANDO 
For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.

ROSALIND 
Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.

ORLANDO 
I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
will be with thee again.

ROSALIND 
Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
death! Two o'clock is your hour?

ORLANDO 
Ay, sweet Rosalind.

ROSALIND 
By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
if you break one jot of your promise or come one
minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
may be chosen out of the gross band of the
unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
your promise.

ORLANDO 
With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
Rosalind: so adieu.

ROSALIND 
Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
offenders, and let Time try: adieu.

Exit ORLANDO

CELIA 
You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
her own nest.

ROSALIND 
O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
bottom, like the bay of Portugal.

CELIA 
Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
affection in, it runs out.

ROSALIND 
No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
sigh till he come.

CELIA 
And I'll sleep.

Exeunt

SCENE II. The forest.

Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters 
JAQUES 
Which is he that killed the deer?

A Lord 
Sir, it was I.

JAQUES 
Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
you no song, forester, for this purpose?

Forester 
Yes, sir.

JAQUES 
Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
make noise enough.
SONG.

Forester 
What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
His leather skin and horns to wear.
Then sing him home;

The rest shall bear this burden

Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
It was a crest ere thou wast born:
Thy father's father wore it,
And thy father bore it:
The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

Exeunt

SCENE III. The forest.

Enter ROSALIND and CELIA 
ROSALIND 
How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
here much Orlando!

CELIA 
I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
sleep. Look, who comes here.

Enter SILVIUS

SILVIUS 
My errand is to you, fair youth;
My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
I know not the contents; but, as I guess
By the stern brow and waspish action
Which she did use as she was writing of it,
It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
I am but as a guiltless messenger.

ROSALIND 
Patience herself would startle at this letter
And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
This is a letter of your own device.

SILVIUS 
No, I protest, I know not the contents:
Phebe did write it.

ROSALIND 
Come, come, you are a fool
And turn'd into the extremity of love.
I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
I say she never did invent this letter;
This is a man's invention and his hand.

SILVIUS 
Sure, it is hers.

ROSALIND 
Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

SILVIUS 
So please you, for I never heard it yet;
Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

ROSALIND 
She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

Reads

Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
Can a woman rail thus?

SILVIUS 
Call you this railing?

ROSALIND 
[Reads]
Why, thy godhead laid apart,
Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
Did you ever hear such railing?
Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
That could do no vengeance to me.
Meaning me a beast.
If the scorn of your bright eyne
Have power to raise such love in mine,
Alack, in me what strange effect
Would they work in mild aspect!
Whiles you chid me, I did love;
How then might your prayers move!
He that brings this love to thee
Little knows this love in me:
And by him seal up thy mind;
Whether that thy youth and kind
Will the faithful offer take
Of me and all that I can make;
Or else by him my love deny,
And then I'll study how to die.

SILVIUS 
Call you this chiding?

CELIA 
Alas, poor shepherd!

ROSALIND 
Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

Exit SILVIUS

Enter OLIVER

OLIVER 
Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?

CELIA 
West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
There's none within.

OLIVER 
If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
Then should I know you by description;
Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
Of female favour, and bestows himself
Like a ripe sister: the woman low
And browner than her brother.' Are not you
The owner of the house I did inquire for?

CELIA 
It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

OLIVER 
Orlando doth commend him to you both,
And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

ROSALIND 
I am: what must we understand by this?

OLIVER 
Some of my shame; if you will know of me
What man I am, and how, and why, and where
This handkercher was stain'd.

CELIA 
I pray you, tell it.

OLIVER 
When last the young Orlando parted from you
He left a promise to return again
Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
And mark what object did present itself:
Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
And high top bald with dry antiquity,
A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
And with indented glides did slip away
Into a bush: under which bush's shade
A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
The royal disposition of that beast
To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
This seen, Orlando did approach the man
And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

CELIA 
O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
And he did render him the most unnatural
That lived amongst men.

OLIVER 
And well he might so do,
For well I know he was unnatural.

ROSALIND 
But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

OLIVER 
Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
Made him give battle to the lioness,
Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
From miserable slumber I awaked.

CELIA 
Are you his brother?

ROSALIND 
Wast you he rescued?

CELIA 
Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

OLIVER 
'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame
To tell you what I was, since my conversion
So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

ROSALIND 
But, for the bloody napkin?

OLIVER 
By and by.
When from the first to last betwixt us two
Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
As how I came into that desert place:--
In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
Committing me unto my brother's love;
Who led me instantly unto his cave,
There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
The lioness had torn some flesh away,
Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
To tell this story, that you might excuse
His broken promise, and to give this napkin
Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

ROSALIND swoons

CELIA 
Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

OLIVER 
Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

CELIA 
There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

OLIVER 
Look, he recovers.

ROSALIND 
I would I were at home.

CELIA 
We'll lead you thither.
I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

OLIVER 
Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
man's heart.
