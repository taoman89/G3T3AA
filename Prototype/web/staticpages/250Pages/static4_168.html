
Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant 
First Merchant 
Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
This very day a Syracusian merchant
Is apprehended for arrival here;
And not being able to buy out his life
According to the statute of the town,
Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
There is your money that I had to keep.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
And then return and sleep within mine inn,
For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
Get thee away.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Many a man would take you at your word,
And go indeed, having so good a mean.

Exit

ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
When I am dull with care and melancholy,
Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
What, will you walk with me about the town,
And then go to my inn and dine with me?

First Merchant 
I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.

First Merchant 
Sir, I commend you to your own content.

Exit

ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
My mistress and her sister stays for you.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
But not a thousand marks between you both.
If I should pay your worship those again,
Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

Exit

ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Upon my life, by some device or other
The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
They say this town is full of cozenage,
As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
And many such-like liberties of sin:
If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
I greatly fear my money is not safe.

Exit


ACT II
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA 
ADRIANA 
Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

LUCIANA 
Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
A man is master of his liberty:
Time is their master, and, when they see time,
They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

ADRIANA 
Why should their liberty than ours be more?

LUCIANA 
Because their business still lies out o' door.

ADRIANA 
Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

LUCIANA 
O, know he is the bridle of your will.

ADRIANA 
There's none but asses will be bridled so.

LUCIANA 
Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
Are masters to their females, and their lords:
Then let your will attend on their accords.

ADRIANA 
This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

LUCIANA 
Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

ADRIANA 
But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA 
Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

ADRIANA 
How if your husband start some other where?

LUCIANA 
Till he come home again, I would forbear.

ADRIANA 
Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
They can be meek that have no other cause.
A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
As much or more would we ourselves complain:
So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

LUCIANA 
Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

ADRIANA 
Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
can witness.

ADRIANA 
Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA 
Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
understand them.

ADRIANA 
But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA 
Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
I mean not cuckold-mad;
But, sure, he is stark mad.
When I desired him to come home to dinner,
He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

LUCIANA 
Quoth who?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Quoth my master:
'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA 
Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Go back again, and be new beaten home?
For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA 
Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
And he will bless that cross with other beating:
Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA 
Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Am I so round with you as you with me,
That like a football you do spurn me thus?
You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

Exit

LUCIANA 
Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

ADRIANA 
His company must do his minions grace,
Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
What ruins are in me that can be found,
By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
A sunny look of his would soon repair
But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA 
Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

ADRIANA 
Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
Or else what lets it but he would be here?
Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
Would that alone, alone he would detain,
So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
I see the jewel best enamelled
Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
That others touch, and often touching will
Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

LUCIANA 
How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse 
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
By computation and mine host's report.
I could not speak with Dromio since at first
I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I did not see you since you sent me hence,
Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

Beating him

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
Upon what bargain do you give it me?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Because that I familiarly sometimes
Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
Your sauciness will jest upon my love
And make a common of my serious hours.
When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
a wherefore.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
nor reason?
Well, sir, I thank you.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Thank me, sir, for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
In good time, sir; what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Basting.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
dry basting.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
pate of father Time himself.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
grows bald by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
lost hair of another man.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
it in a kind of jollity.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
For two; and sound ones too.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, not sound, I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Sure ones, then.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Certain ones then.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Name them.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
The one, to save the money that he spends in
trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
drop in his porridge.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
You would all this time have proved there is no
time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
lost by nature.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
to the world's end will have bald followers.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA 
Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
That never words were music to thine ear,
That never object pleasing in thine eye,
That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
That, undividable, incorporate,
Am better than thy dear self's better part.
Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
And take unmingled that same drop again,
Without addition or diminishing,
As take from me thyself and not me too.
How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
And that this body, consecrate to thee,
By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
And hurl the name of husband in my face
And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
For if we too be one and thou play false,
I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
As strange unto your town as to your talk;
Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
Want wit in all one word to understand.

LUCIANA 
Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
When were you wont to use my sister thus?
She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
By Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
By me?

ADRIANA 
By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
What is the course and drift of your compact?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I never spake with her in all my life.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
How can she thus then call us by our names,
Unless it be by inspiration.

ADRIANA 
How ill agrees it with your gravity
To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
What, was I married to her in my dream?
Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
Until I know this sure uncertainty,
I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

LUCIANA 
Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
If we obey them not, this will ensue,
They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

LUCIANA 
Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
I am transformed, master, am I not?
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Thou hast thine own form.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
No, I am an ape.

LUCIANA 
If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
But I should know her as well as she knows me.

ADRIANA 
Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
To put the finger in the eye and weep,
Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE 
Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
I'll say as they say and persever so,
And in this mist at all adventures go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

ADRIANA 
Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

LUCIANA 
Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR 
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
To see the making of her carcanet,
And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
But here's a villain that would face me down
He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
And that I did deny my wife and house.
Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
I think thou art an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Marry, so it doth appear
By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

BALTHAZAR 
I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
welcome dear.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

BALTHAZAR 
Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

BALTHAZAR 
Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
idiot, patch!
Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
for such store,
When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
the street.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
catch cold on's feet.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
me wherefore.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
when you may.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name
is Dromio.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
name for an ass.

LUCE 
[Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
at the gate?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Let my master in, Luce.

LUCE 
[Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;
And so tell your master.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
O Lord, I must laugh!
Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?

LUCE 
[Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?
can you tell?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
answered him well.

ANTIPHOLUS 
Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
OF EPHESUS

LUCE 
[Within] I thought to have asked you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] And you said no.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Thou baggage, let me in.

LUCE 
[Within] Can you tell for whose sake?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Master, knock the door hard.

LUCE 
[Within] Let him knock till it ache.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

LUCE 
[Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

ADRIANA 
[Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all
this noise?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with
unruly boys.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

ADRIANA 
[Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

ANGELO 
Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
fain have either.

BALTHAZAR 
In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
knave's pate.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
thee, hind!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
let me in.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE 
[Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS 
A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

BALTHAZAR 
Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
Herein you war against your reputation
And draw within the compass of suspect
The unviolated honour of your wife.
Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
Why at this time the doors are made against you.
Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
And about evening come yourself alone
To know the reason of this strange restraint.
If by strong hand you offer to break in
Now in the stirring passage of the day,
A vulgar comment will be made of it,
And that supposed by the common rout
Against your yet ungalled estimation
That may with foul intrusion enter in
And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
For slander lives upon succession,
For ever housed where it gets possession.
ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS 
You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse,
Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
To her will we to dinner.

To Angelo

Get you home
And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

ACT I
SCENE I. London. The palace.

Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others 
KING HENRY IV 
So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
To be commenced in strands afar remote.
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
All of one nature, of one substance bred,
Did lately meet in the intestine shock
And furious close of civil butchery
Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
March all one way and be no more opposed
Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
We are impressed and engaged to fight,
Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
To chase these pagans in those holy fields
Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
For our advantage on the bitter cross.
But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
What yesternight our council did decree
In forwarding this dear expedience.

WESTMORELAND 
My liege, this haste was hot in question,
And many limits of the charge set down
But yesternight: when all athwart there came
A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
A thousand of his people butchered;
Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
Such beastly shameless transformation,
By those Welshwomen done as may not be
Without much shame retold or spoken of.

KING HENRY IV 
It seems then that the tidings of this broil
Brake off our business for the Holy Land.

WESTMORELAND 
This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
For more uneven and unwelcome news
Came from the north and thus it did import:
On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
At Holmedon met,
Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
As by discharge of their artillery,
And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
For he that brought them, in the very heat
And pride of their contention did take horse,
Uncertain of the issue any way.

KING HENRY IV 
Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
Stain'd with the variation of each soil
Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
And is not this an honourable spoil?
A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?

WESTMORELAND 
In faith,
It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.

KING HENRY IV 
Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
In envy that my Lord Northumberland
Should be the father to so blest a son,
A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
See riot and dishonour stain the brow
Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.

WESTMORELAND 
This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
Malevolent to you in all aspects;
Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
The crest of youth against your dignity.

KING HENRY IV 
But I have sent for him to answer this;
And for this cause awhile we must neglect
Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
But come yourself with speed to us again;
For more is to be said and to be done
Than out of anger can be uttered.

WESTMORELAND 
I will, my liege.

Exeunt

SCENE II. London. An apartment of the Prince's.

Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF 
FALSTAFF 
Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?

PRINCE HENRY 
Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
the time of the day.

FALSTAFF 
Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
thou wilt have none,--

PRINCE HENRY 
What, none?

FALSTAFF 
No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
prologue to an egg and butter.

PRINCE HENRY 
Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.

FALSTAFF 
Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
us that are squires of the night's body be called
thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.

PRINCE HENRY 
Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.

FALSTAFF 
By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?

PRINCE HENRY 
As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?

FALSTAFF 
How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
buff jerkin?

PRINCE HENRY 
Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?

FALSTAFF 
Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
time and oft.

PRINCE HENRY 
Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?

FALSTAFF 
No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.

PRINCE HENRY 
Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
and where it would not, I have used my credit.

FALSTAFF 
Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.

PRINCE HENRY 
No; thou shalt.

FALSTAFF 
Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.

PRINCE HENRY 
Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.

FALSTAFF 
Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
you.

PRINCE HENRY 
For obtaining of suits?

FALSTAFF 
Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
as a gib cat or a lugged bear.

PRINCE HENRY 
Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.

FALSTAFF 
Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.

PRINCE HENRY 
What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
Moor-ditch?

FALSTAFF 
Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
lord of the council rated me the other day in the
street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.

PRINCE HENRY 
Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
streets, and no man regards it.

FALSTAFF 
O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
should speak truly, little better than one of the
wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
I'll be damned for never a king's son in
Christendom.

PRINCE HENRY 
Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?

FALSTAFF 
'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
do not, call me villain and baffle me.

PRINCE HENRY 
I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
to purse-taking.

FALSTAFF 
Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
man to labour in his vocation.

Enter POINS

Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
a true man.

PRINCE HENRY 
Good morrow, Ned.

POINS 
Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
and a cold capon's leg?

PRINCE HENRY 
Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
proverbs: he will give the devil his due.

POINS 
Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.

PRINCE HENRY 
Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.

POINS 
But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
at home and be hanged.

FALSTAFF 
Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
I'll hang you for going.

POINS 
You will, chops?

FALSTAFF 
Hal, wilt thou make one?

PRINCE HENRY 
Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.

FALSTAFF 
There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
