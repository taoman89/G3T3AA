To drench the Capitol; but that they would
Have one man but a man? And that is it
Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
Cast on my noble father.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Take your time.

MARK ANTONY 
Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
How much we do o'er-count thee.

POMPEY 
At land, indeed,
Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
Remain in't as thou mayst.

LEPIDUS 
Be pleased to tell us--
For this is from the present--how you take
The offers we have sent you.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
There's the point.

MARK ANTONY 
Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
What it is worth embraced.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
And what may follow,
To try a larger fortune.

POMPEY 
You have made me offer
Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
Our targes undinted.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS 
That's our offer.

POMPEY 
Know, then,
I came before you here a man prepared
To take this offer: but Mark Antony
Put me to some impatience: though I lose
The praise of it by telling, you must know,
When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
Your mother came to Sicily and did find
Her welcome friendly.

MARK ANTONY 
I have heard it, Pompey;
And am well studied for a liberal thanks
Which I do owe you.

POMPEY 
Let me have your hand:
I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

MARK ANTONY 
The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
For I have gain'd by 't.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Since I saw you last,
There is a change upon you.

POMPEY 
Well, I know not
What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
But in my bosom shall she never come,
To make my heart her vassal.

LEPIDUS 
Well met here.

POMPEY 
I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
I crave our composition may be written,
And seal'd between us.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
That's the next to do.

POMPEY 
We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
Draw lots who shall begin.

MARK ANTONY 
That will I, Pompey.

POMPEY 
No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
Grew fat with feasting there.

MARK ANTONY 
You have heard much.

POMPEY 
I have fair meanings, sir.

MARK ANTONY 
And fair words to them.

POMPEY 
Then so much have I heard:
And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
No more of that: he did so.

POMPEY 
What, I pray you?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

POMPEY 
I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Well;
And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
Four feasts are toward.

POMPEY 
Let me shake thy hand;
I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
When I have envied thy behavior.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Sir,
I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
When you have well deserved ten times as much
As I have said you did.

POMPEY 
Enjoy thy plainness,
It nothing ill becomes thee.
Aboard my galley I invite you all:
Will you lead, lords?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS 
Show us the way, sir.

POMPEY 
Come.

Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS

MENAS 
[Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
At sea, I think.

MENAS 
We have, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
You have done well by water.

MENAS 
And you by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
cannot be denied what I have done by land.

MENAS 
Nor what I have done by water.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Yes, something you can deny for your own
safety: you have been a great thief by sea.

MENAS 
And you by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
There I deny my land service. But give me your
hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
might take two thieves kissing.

MENAS 
All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

MENAS 
No slander; they steal hearts.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS 
For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.

MENAS 
You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

MENAS 
True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS 
Pray ye, sir?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
'Tis true.

MENAS 
Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
not prophesy so.

MENAS 
I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
marriage than the love of the parties.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
seems to tie their friendship together will be the
very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
holy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS 
Who would not have his wife so?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
I said before, that which is the strength of their
amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
he married but his occasion here.

MENAS 
And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
I have a health for you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.

MENAS 
Come, let's away.

Exeunt

SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.

Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet 
First Servant 
Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
will blow them down.

Second Servant 
Lepidus is high-coloured.

First Servant 
They have made him drink alms-drink.

Second Servant 
As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
entreaty, and himself to the drink.

First Servant 
But it raises the greater war between him and
his discretion.

Second Servant 
Why, this is to have a name in great men's
fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
me no service as a partisan I could not heave.

First Servant 
To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains

MARK ANTONY 
[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
the flow o' the Nile
By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
And shortly comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS 
You've strange serpents there.

MARK ANTONY 
Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS 
Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.

MARK ANTONY 
They are so.

POMPEY 
Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS 
I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

LEPIDUS 
Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
pyramises are very goodly things; without
contradiction, I have heard that.

MENAS 
[Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
what is't?

MENAS 
[Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
thee, captain,
And hear me speak a word.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
This wine for Lepidus!

LEPIDUS 
What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

MARK ANTONY 
It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
it, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS 
What colour is it of?

MARK ANTONY 
Of it own colour too.

LEPIDUS 
'Tis a strange serpent.

MARK ANTONY 
'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Will this description satisfy him?

MARK ANTONY 
With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
very epicure.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
that? away!
Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?

MENAS 
[Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
wilt hear me,
Rise from thy stool.

POMPEY 
[Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
The matter?

Rises, and walks aside

MENAS 
I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

POMPEY 
Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
Be jolly, lords.

MARK ANTONY 
These quick-sands, Lepidus,
Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS 
Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY 
What say'st thou?

MENAS 
Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY 
How should that be?

MENAS 
But entertain it,
And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY 
Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS 
Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY 
Show me which way.

MENAS 
These three world-sharers, these competitors,
Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
All there is thine.

POMPEY 
Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
I should have found it afterwards well done;
But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS 
[Aside] For this,
I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
Shall never find it more.

POMPEY 
This health to Lepidus!

MARK ANTONY 
Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS 
Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY 
Fill till the cup be hid.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
There's a strong fellow, Menas.

Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS

MENAS 
Why?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
not?

MENAS 
The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
That it might go on wheels!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS 
Come.

POMPEY 
This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

MARK ANTONY 
It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
Here is to Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I could well forbear't.
It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
And it grows fouler.

MARK ANTONY 
Be a child o' the time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Possess it, I'll make answer:
But I had rather fast from all four days
Than drink so much in one.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ha, my brave emperor!

To MARK ANTONY

Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY 
Let's ha't, good soldier.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, let's all take hands,
Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
In soft and delicate Lethe.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
All take hands.
Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
The holding every man shall bear as loud
As his strong sides can volley.

Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand

THE SONG.
Come, thou monarch of the vine,
Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
Cup us, till the world go round,
Cup us, till the world go round!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
Let me request you off: our graver business
Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY 
I'll try you on the shore.

MARK ANTONY 
And shall, sir; give's your hand.

POMPEY 
O Antony,
You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
Come, down into the boat.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Take heed you fall not.

Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS

Menas, I'll not on shore.

MENAS 
No, to my cabin.
These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!

Sound a flourish, with drums

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ho! says a' There's my cap.

MENAS 
Ho! Noble captain, come.

Exeunt


ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.

Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him 
VENTIDIUS 
Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS 
Noble Ventidius,
Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS 
O Silius, Silius,
I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
Better to leave undone, than by our deed
Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
Caesar and Antony have ever won
More in their officer than person: Sossius,
One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
For quick accumulation of renown,
Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
Than gain which darkens him.
I could do more to do Antonius good,
But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
Should my performance perish.

SILIUS 
Thou hast, Ventidius,
that
Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!

VENTIDIUS 
I'll humbly signify what in his name,
That magical word of war, we have effected;
How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
We have jaded out o' the field.

SILIUS 
Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS 
He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
The weight we must convey with's will permit,
We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!

Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another 
AGRIPPA 
What, are the brothers parted?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA 
'Tis a noble Lepidus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA 
Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA 
What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

AGRIPPA 
O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.

AGRIPPA 
Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
poets, cannot
Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA 
Both he loves.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
They are his shards, and he their beetle.

Trumpets within

So;
This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA 
Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY 
No further, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
You take from me a great part of myself;
Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
The fortress of it; for better might we
Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
This be not cherish'd.

MARK ANTONY 
Make me not offended
In your distrust.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I have said.

MARK ANTONY 
You shall not find,
Though you be therein curious, the least cause
For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
We will here part.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
The elements be kind to thee, and make
Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.

OCTAVIA 
My noble brother!

MARK ANTONY 
The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

OCTAVIA 
Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA 
I'll tell you in your ear.

MARK ANTONY 
Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
down-feather,
That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
And neither way inclines.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
were he a horse;
So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
troubled with a rheum;
What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
Believe't, till I wept too.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
No, sweet Octavia,
You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
Out-go my thinking on you.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, sir, come;
I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
And give you to the gods.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Adieu; be happy!

LEPIDUS 
Let all the number of the stars give light
To thy fair way!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Farewell, fa rewell!

Kisses OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY 
Farewell!

Trumpets sound. Exeunt

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS 
CLEOPATRA 
Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS 
Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA 
Go to, go to.

Enter the Messenger as before

Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS 
Good majesty,
Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
But when you are well pleased.

CLEOPATRA 
That Herod's head
I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

Messenger 
Most gracious majesty,--

CLEOPATRA 
Didst thou behold Octavia?

Messenger 
Ay, dread queen.

CLEOPATRA 
Where?

Messenger 
Madam, in Rome;
I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA 
Is she as tall as me?

Messenger 
She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

Messenger 
Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.

CLEOPATRA 
That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN 
Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA 
I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

Messenger 
She creeps:
Her motion and her station are as one;
She shows a body rather than a life,
A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA 
Is this certain?

Messenger 
Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN 
Three in Egypt
Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA 
He's very knowing;
I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN 
Excellent.

CLEOPATRA 
Guess at her years, I prithee.

Messenger 
Madam,
She was a widow,--

CLEOPATRA 
Widow! Charmian, hark.

Messenger 
And I do think she's thirty.

CLEOPATRA 
Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?

Messenger 
Round even to faultiness.

CLEOPATRA 
For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
Her hair, what colour?

Messenger 
Brown, madam: and her forehead
As low as she would wish it.

CLEOPATRA 
There's gold for thee.
Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
I will employ thee back again; I find thee
Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
Our letters are prepared.

Exit Messenger

CHARMIAN 
A proper man.

CLEOPATRA 
Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN 
Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA 
The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN 
Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA 
I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
Where I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN 
I warrant you, madam.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.

Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA 
MARK ANTONY 
Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
That were excusable, that, and thousands more
Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
To public ear:
Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
Or did it from his teeth.

OCTAVIA 
O my good lord,
Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
Praying for both parts:
The good gods me presently,
When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
'Twixt these extremes at all.

MARK ANTONY 
Gentle Octavia,
Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
I lose myself: better I were not yours
Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
I'll raise the preparation of a war
Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
So your desires are yours.

OCTAVIA 
Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
Should solder up the rift.

MARK ANTONY 
When it appears to you where this begins,
Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
Can never be so equal, that your love
Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
Choose your own company, and command what cost
Your heart has mind to.

Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. Another room.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting 
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
How now, friend Eros!

EROS 
There's strange news come, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What, man?

EROS 
Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
This is old: what is the success?

EROS 
Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
him partake in the glory of the action: and not
resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
And throw between them all the food thou hast,
They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS 
He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
And threats the throat of that his officer
That murder'd Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS 
For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
My lord desires you presently: my news
I might have told hereafter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
'Twill be naught:
But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS 
Come, sir.

Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
And all the unlawful issue that their lust
Since then hath made between them. Unto her
He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
Absolute queen.

MECAENAS 
This in the public eye?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
As 'tis reported, so.

MECAENAS 
Let Rome be thus Inform'd.

AGRIPPA 
Who, queasy with his insolence
Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
The people know it; and have now received
His accusations.

AGRIPPA 
Who does he accuse?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
That Lepidus of the triumvirate
Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
All his revenue.

AGRIPPA 
Sir, this should be answer'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
That he his high authority abused,
And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
Demand the like.

MECAENAS 
He'll never yield to that.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

Enter OCTAVIA with her train

OCTAVIA 
Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
That ever I should call thee castaway!

OCTAVIA 
You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
Should have an army for an usher, and
The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
Is often left unloved; we should have met you
By sea and land; supplying every stage
With an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA 
Good my lord,
To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
His pardon for return.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Which soon he granted,
Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA 
Do not say so, my lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
I have eyes upon him,
And his affairs come to me on the wind.
Where is he now?

OCTAVIA 
My lord, in Athens.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
Up to a whore; who now are levying
The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
With a more larger list of sceptres.

OCTAVIA 
Ay me, most wretched,
That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
That do afflict each other!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Welcome hither:
Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
O'er your content these strong necessities;
But let determined things to destiny
Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
To do you justice, make them ministers
Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA 
Welcome, lady.

MECAENAS 
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
Only the adulterous Antony, most large
In his abominations, turns you off;
And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA 
Is it so, sir?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!

Exeunt

SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.

Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
CLEOPATRA 
I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
But why, why, why?

CLEOPATRA 
Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
And say'st it is not fit.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA 
If not denounced against us, why should not we
Be there in person?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] Well, I could reply:
If we should serve with horse and mares together,
The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
A soldier and his horse.

CLEOPATRA 
What is't you say?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
Take from his heart, take from his brain,
from's time,
What should not then be spared. He is already
Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
Manage this war.

CLEOPATRA 
Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
And, as the president of my kingdom, will
Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
I will not stay behind.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Nay, I have done.
Here comes the emperor.

Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS

MARK ANTONY 
Is it not strange, Canidius,
That from Tarentum and Brundusium
He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?

CLEOPATRA 
Celerity is never more admired
Than by the negligent.

MARK ANTONY 
A good rebuke,
Which might have well becomed the best of men,
To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
Will fight with him by sea.

CLEOPATRA 
By sea! what else?

CANIDIUS 
Why will my lord do so?

MARK ANTONY 
For that he dares us to't.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

CANIDIUS 
Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
And so should you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Your ships are not well mann'd;
Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
Being prepared for land.

MARK ANTONY 
By sea, by sea.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
The absolute soldiership you have by land;
Distract your army, which doth most consist
Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
The way which promises assurance; and
Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
From firm security.

MARK ANTONY 
I'll fight at sea.

CLEOPATRA 
I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

MARK ANTONY 
Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
We then can do't at land.

Enter a Messenger

Thy business?

Messenger 
The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
Caesar has taken Toryne.

MARK ANTONY 
Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
Strange that power should be. Canidius,
Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
Away, my Thetis!

Enter a Soldier

How now, worthy soldier?

Soldier 
O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
And fighting foot to foot.

MARK ANTONY 
Well, well: away!

Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Soldier 
By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.

CANIDIUS 
Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
And we are women's men.

Soldier 
You keep by land
The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

CANIDIUS 
Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
Carries beyond belief.

Soldier 
While he was yet in Rome,
His power went out in such distractions as
Beguiled all spies.

CANIDIUS 
Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

Soldier 
They say, one Taurus.

CANIDIUS 
Well I know the man.

Enter a Messenger

Messenger 
The emperor calls Canidius.

CANIDIUS 
With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
Each minute, some.

Exeunt

SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Taurus!

TAURUS 
My lord?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,
Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
Upon this jump.

Exeunt

SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.

Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
MARK ANTONY 
Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,
In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
We may the number of the ships behold,
And so proceed accordingly.

Exeunt

SCENE X. Another part of the plain.

CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight 

Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
To see't mine eyes are blasted.

Enter SCARUS

SCARUS 
Gods and goddesses,
All the whole synod of them!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What's thy passion!

SCARUS 
The greater cantle of the world is lost
With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
Kingdoms and provinces.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
How appears the fight?

SCARUS 
On our side like the token'd pestilence,
Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
Hoists sails and flies.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
That I beheld:
Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
Endure a further view.

SCARUS 
She once being loof'd,
The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
I never saw an action of such shame;
Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
Did violate so itself.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Alack, alack!

Enter CANIDIUS

CANIDIUS 
Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
O, he has given example for our flight,
Most grossly, by his own!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Ay, are you thereabouts?
Why, then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS 
Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

SCARUS 
'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
What further comes.

CANIDIUS 
To Caesar will I render
My legions and my horse: six kings already
Show me the way of yielding.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I'll yet follow
The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
Sits in the wind against me.

Exeunt

SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants 
MARK ANTONY 
Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
I am so lated in the world, that I
Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
And make your peace with Caesar.

All 
Fly! not we.

MARK ANTONY 
I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
I have myself resolved upon a course
Which has no need of you; be gone:
My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
Have letters from me to some friends that will
Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.

Sits down

Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following

EROS 
Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

IRAS 
Do, most dear queen.

CHARMIAN 
Do! why: what else?

CLEOPATRA 
Let me sit down. O Juno!

MARK ANTONY 
No, no, no, no, no.

EROS 
See you here, sir?

MARK ANTONY 
O fie, fie, fie!

CHARMIAN 
Madam!

IRAS 
Madam, O good empress!

EROS 
Sir, sir,--

MARK ANTONY 
Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.

CLEOPATRA 
Ah, stand by.

EROS 
The queen, my lord, the queen.

IRAS 
Go to him, madam, speak to him:
He is unqualitied with very shame.

CLEOPATRA 
Well then, sustain him: O!

EROS 
Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
Your comfort makes the rescue.

MARK ANTONY 
I have offended reputation,
A most unnoble swerving.

EROS 
Sir, the queen.

MARK ANTONY 
O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
By looking back what I have left behind
'Stroy'd in dishonour.

CLEOPATRA 
O my lord, my lord,
Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
You would have follow'd.

MARK ANTONY 
Egypt, thou knew'st too well
My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
Command me.

CLEOPATRA 
O, my pardon!

MARK ANTONY 
Now I must
To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
Making and marring fortunes. You did know
How much you were my conqueror; and that
My sword, made weak by my affection, would
Obey it on all cause.

CLEOPATRA 
Pardon, pardon!

MARK ANTONY 
Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

Exeunt

SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Let him appear that's come from Antony.
Know you him?

DOLABELLA 
Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
Which had superfluous kings for messengers
Not many moons gone by.

Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Approach, and speak.

EUPHRONIUS 
Such as I am, I come from Antony:
I was of late as petty to his ends
As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
To his grand sea.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Be't so: declare thine office.

EUPHRONIUS 
Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
A private man in Athens: this for him.
Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
Now hazarded to thy grace.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
For Antony,
I have no ears to his request. The queen
Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
Or take his life there: this if she perform,
She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

EUPHRONIUS 
Fortune pursue thee!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Bring him through the bands.

Exit EUPHRONIUS

To THYREUS

From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
And in our name, what she requires; add more,
From thine invention, offers: women are not
In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
Will answer as a law.

THYREUS 
Caesar, I go.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
And what thou think'st his very action speaks
In every power that moves.

THYREUS 
Caesar, I shall.

Exeunt

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS 
CLEOPATRA 
What shall we do, Enobarbus?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA 
Is Antony or we in fault for this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Antony only, that would make his will
Lord of his reason. What though you fled
From that great face of war, whose several ranges
Frighted each other? why should he follow?
The itch of his affection should not then
Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
When half to half the world opposed, he being
The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA 
Prithee, peace.

Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador

MARK ANTONY 
Is that his answer?

EUPHRONIUS 
Ay, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
Will yield us up.

EUPHRONIUS 
He says so.

MARK ANTONY 
Let her know't.
To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
With principalities.

CLEOPATRA 
That head, my lord?

MARK ANTONY 
To him again: tell him he wears the rose
Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
Under the service of a child as soon
As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
To lay his gay comparisons apart,
And answer me declined, sword against sword,
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.

Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
Do draw the inward quality after them,
To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
His judgment too.

Enter an Attendant

Attendant 
A messenger from CAESAR.

CLEOPATRA 
What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.

Exit Attendant

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
The loyalty well held to fools does make
Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
Does conquer him that did his master conquer
And earns a place i' the story.

Enter THYREUS

CLEOPATRA 
Caesar's will?

THYREUS 
Hear it apart.

CLEOPATRA 
None but friends: say boldly.

THYREUS 
So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.

THYREUS 
So.
Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
Further than he is Caesar.

CLEOPATRA 
Go on: right royal.

THYREUS 
He knows that you embrace not Antony
As you did love, but as you fear'd him.

CLEOPATRA 
O!

THYREUS 
The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
Not as deserved.

CLEOPATRA 
He is a god, and knows
What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
But conquer'd merely.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] To be sure of that,
I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
Thy dearest quit thee.

Exit

THYREUS 
Shall I say to Caesar
What you require of him? for he partly begs
To be desired to give. It much would please him,
That of his fortunes you should make a staff
To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
To hear from me you had left Antony,
And put yourself under his shrowd,
The universal landlord.

CLEOPATRA 
What's your name?

THYREUS 
My name is Thyreus.

CLEOPATRA 
Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
The doom of Egypt.

THYREUS 
'Tis your noblest course.
Wisdom and fortune combating together,
If that the former dare but what it can,
No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
My duty on your hand.

CLEOPATRA 
Your Caesar's father oft,
When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
As it rain'd kisses.

Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

MARK ANTONY 
Favours, by Jove that thunders!
What art thou, fellow?

THYREUS 
One that but performs
The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
To have command obey'd.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] You will be whipp'd.

MARK ANTONY 
Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
and devils!
Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
Antony yet.

Enter Attendants

Take hence this Jack, and whip him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
Than with an old one dying.

MARK ANTONY 
Moon and stars!
Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.

THYREUS 
Mark Antony!

MARK ANTONY 
Tug him away: being whipp'd,
Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
Bear us an errand to him.

Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS

You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
And by a gem of women, to be abused
By one that looks on feeders?

CLEOPATRA 
Good my lord,--

MARK ANTONY 
You have been a boggler ever:
But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
To our confusion.

CLEOPATRA 
O, is't come to this?

MARK ANTONY 
I found you as a morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
Though you can guess what temperance should be,
You know not what it is.

CLEOPATRA 
Wherefore is this?

MARK ANTONY 
To let a fellow that will take rewards
And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
And to proclaim it civilly, were like
A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
For being yare about him.

Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS

Is he whipp'd?

First Attendant 
Soundly, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?

First Attendant 
He did ask favour.

MARK ANTONY 
If that thy father live, let him repent
Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
The white hand of a lady fever thee,
Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
He makes me angry with him; for he seems
Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
When my good stars, that were my former guides,
Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
My speech and what is done, tell him he has
Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
Hence with thy stripes, begone!

Exit THYREUS

CLEOPATRA 
Have you done yet?

MARK ANTONY 
Alack, our terrene moon
Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
The fall of Antony!

CLEOPATRA 
I must stay his time.

MARK ANTONY 
To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
With one that ties his points?

CLEOPATRA 
Not know me yet?

MARK ANTONY 
Cold-hearted toward me?

CLEOPATRA 
Ah, dear, if I be so,
From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
And poison it in the source; and the first stone
Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
Together with my brave Egyptians all,
By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
Have buried them for prey!

MARK ANTONY 
I am satisfied.
Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
If from the field I shall return once more
To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
There's hope in't yet.

CLEOPATRA 
That's my brave lord!

MARK ANTONY 
I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
Let's mock the midnight bell.

CLEOPATRA 
It is my birth-day:
I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

MARK ANTONY 
We will yet do well.

CLEOPATRA 
Call all his noble captains to my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
I'll make death love me; for I will contend
Even with his pestilent scythe.

Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
A diminution in our captain's brain
Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
Some way to leave him.

Exit


ACT IV
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
I have many other ways to die; meantime
Laugh at his challenge.

MECAENAS 
Caesar must think,
When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
Make boot of his distraction: never anger
Made good guard for itself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Let our best heads
Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
We mean to fight: within our files there are,
Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
And feast the army; we have store to do't,
And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

Exeunt

SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others 
MARK ANTONY 
He will not fight with me, Domitius.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
No.

MARK ANTONY 
Why should he not?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
He is twenty men to one.

MARK ANTONY 
To-morrow, soldier,
By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

MARK ANTONY 
Well said; come on.
Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
Be bounteous at our meal.

Enter three or four Servitors

Give me thy hand,
Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
And kings have been your fellows.

CLEOPATRA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
tricks which sorrow shoots
Out of the mind.

MARK ANTONY 
And thou art honest too.
I wish I could be made so many men,
And all of you clapp'd up together in
An Antony, that I might do you service
So good as you have done.

All 
The gods forbid!

MARK ANTONY 
Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
As when mine empire was your fellow too,
And suffer'd my command.

CLEOPATRA 
[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
[Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.

MARK ANTONY 
Tend me to-night;
May be it is the period of your duty:
Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
You'll serve another master. I look on you
As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
I turn you not away; but, like a master
Married to your good service, stay till death:
Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
And the gods yield you for't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
What mean you, sir,
To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
Transform us not to women.

MARK ANTONY 
Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall!
My hearty friends,
You take me in too dolorous a sense;
For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
Where rather I'll expect victorious life
Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
And drown consideration.

Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.

Enter two Soldiers to their guard 
First Soldier 
Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.

Second Soldier 
It will determine one way: fare you well.
Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

First Soldier 
Nothing. What news?

Second Soldier 
Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.

First Soldier 
Well, sir, good night.

Enter two other Soldiers

Second Soldier 
Soldiers, have careful watch.

Third Soldier 
And you. Good night, good night.

They place themselves in every corner of the stage

Fourth Soldier 
Here we: and if to-morrow
Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
Our landmen will stand up.

Third Soldier 
'Tis a brave army,
And full of purpose.

Music of the hautboys as under the stage

Fourth Soldier 
Peace! what noise?

First Soldier 
List, list!

Second Soldier 
Hark!

First Soldier 
Music i' the air.

Third Soldier 
Under the earth.

Fourth Soldier 
It signs well, does it not?

Third Soldier 
No.

First Soldier 
Peace, I say!
What should this mean?

Second Soldier 
'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
Now leaves him.

First Soldier 
Walk; let's see if other watchmen
Do hear what we do?

They advance to another post

Second Soldier 
How now, masters!

All 
[Speaking together] How now!
How now! do you hear this?

First Soldier 
Ay; is't not strange?

Third Soldier 
Do you hear, masters? do you hear?

First Soldier 
Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
Let's see how it will give off.

All 
Content. 'Tis strange.

Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.

Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending 
MARK ANTONY 
Eros! mine armour, Eros!

CLEOPATRA 
Sleep a little.

MARK ANTONY 
No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!

Enter EROS with armour

Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
Because we brave her: come.

CLEOPATRA 
Nay, I'll help too.
What's this for?

MARK ANTONY 
Ah, let be, let be! thou art
The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.

CLEOPATRA 
Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.

MARK ANTONY 
Well, well;
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
Go put on thy defences.

EROS 
Briefly, sir.

CLEOPATRA 
Is not this buckled well?

MARK ANTONY 
Rarely, rarely:
He that unbuckles this, till we do please
To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
A workman in't.

Enter an armed Soldier

Good morrow to thee; welcome:
Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
To business that we love we rise betime,
And go to't with delight.

Soldier 
A thousand, sir,
Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
And at the port expect you.

Shout. Trumpets flourish

Enter Captains and Soldiers

Captain 
The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

All 
Good morrow, general.

MARK ANTONY 
'Tis well blown, lads:
This morning, like the spirit of a youth
That means to be of note, begins betimes.
So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable

Kisses her

And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers

CHARMIAN 
Please you, retire to your chamber.

CLEOPATRA 
Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
Determine this great war in single fight!
Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.

Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.

Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them 
Soldier 
The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

MARK ANTONY 
Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
To make me fight at land!

Soldier 
Hadst thou done so,
The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
That has this morning left thee, would have still
Follow'd thy heels.

MARK ANTONY 
Who's gone this morning?

Soldier 
Who!
One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
Say 'I am none of thine.'

MARK ANTONY 
What say'st thou?

Soldier 
Sir,
He is with Caesar.

EROS 
Sir, his chests and treasure
He has not with him.

MARK ANTONY 
Is he gone?

Soldier 
Most certain.

MARK ANTONY 
Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
Say that I wish he never find more cause
To change a master. O, my fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!

Exeunt

SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, and others 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
Our will is Antony be took alive;
Make it so known.

AGRIPPA 
Caesar, I shall.

Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
The time of universal peace is near:
Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
Shall bear the olive freely.

Enter a Messenger

Messenger 
Antony
Is come into the field.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Go charge Agrippa
Plant those that have revolted in the van,
That Antony may seem to spend his fury
Upon himself.

Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
And leave his master Antony: for this pains
Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
That fell away have entertainment, but
No honourable trust. I have done ill;
Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
That I will joy no more.

Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's

Soldier 
Enobarbus, Antony
Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
His bounty overplus: the messenger
Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
Unloading of his mules.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I give it you.

Soldier 
Mock not, Enobarbus.
I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
Continues still a Jove.

Exit

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
I am alone the villain of the earth,
And feel I am so most. O Antony,
Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
My better service, when my turpitude
Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
My latter part of life.

Exit

SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.

Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others 
AGRIPPA 
Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
Exceeds what we expected.

Exeunt

Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded

SCARUS 
O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
With clouts about their heads.

MARK ANTONY 
Thou bleed'st apace.

SCARUS 
I had a wound here that was like a T,
But now 'tis made an H.

MARK ANTONY 
They do retire.

SCARUS 
We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
Room for six scotches more.

Enter EROS

EROS 
They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
For a fair victory.

SCARUS 
Let us score their backs,
And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
'Tis sport to maul a runner.

MARK ANTONY 
I will reward thee
Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
For thy good valour. Come thee on.

SCARUS 
I'll halt after.

Exeunt

SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.

Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS, with others 
MARK ANTONY 
We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
The honour'd gashes whole.

To SCARUS

Give me thy hand

Enter CLEOPATRA, attended

To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
Make her thanks bless thee.

To CLEOPATRA

O thou day o' the world,
Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
Ride on the pants triumphing!

CLEOPATRA 
Lord of lords!
O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?

MARK ANTONY 
My nightingale,
We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
though grey
Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
Destroy'd in such a shape.

CLEOPATRA 
I'll give thee, friend,
An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

MARK ANTONY 
He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
Had our great palace the capacity
To camp this host, we all would sup together,
And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
Applauding our approach.

Exeunt

SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Sentinels at their post 
First Soldier 
If we be not relieved within this hour,
We must return to the court of guard: the night
Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
By the second hour i' the morn.

Second Soldier 
This last day was
A shrewd one to's.

Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
O, bear me witness, night,--

Third Soldier 
What man is this?

Second Soldier 
Stand close, and list him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
When men revolted shall upon record
Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
Before thy face repent!

First Soldier 
Enobarbus!

Third Soldier 
Peace!
Hark further.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS 
O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
That life, a very rebel to my will,
May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
Forgive me in thine own particular;
But let the world rank me in register
A master-leaver and a fugitive:
O Antony! O Antony!

Dies

Second Soldier 
Let's speak To him.

First Soldier 
Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
May concern Caesar.

Third Soldier 
Let's do so. But he sleeps.

First Soldier 
Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
Was never yet for sleep.

Second Soldier 
Go we to him.

Third Soldier 
Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

Second Soldier 
Hear you, sir?

First Soldier 
The hand of death hath raught him.

Drums afar off

Hark! the drums
Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
Is fully out.

Third Soldier 
Come on, then;
He may recover yet.

Exeunt with the body

SCENE X. Between the two camps.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army 
MARK ANTONY 
Their preparation is to-day by sea;
We please them not by land.

SCARUS 
For both, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
Upon the hills adjoining to the city
Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
They have put forth the haven
Where their appointment we may best discover,
And look on their endeavour.

Exeunt

SCENE XI. Another part of the same.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
But being charged, we will be still by land,
Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
And hold our best advantage.

Exeunt

SCENE XII. Another part of the same.

Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS 
MARK ANTONY 
Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
does stand,
I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
Straight, how 'tis like to go.

Exit

SCARUS 
Swallows have built
In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
Of what he has, and has not.

Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight

Re-enter MARK ANTONY

MARK ANTONY 
All is lost;
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
'tis thou
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am revenged upon my charm,
I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.

Exit SCARUS

O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
What, Eros, Eros!

Enter CLEOPATRA

Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

CLEOPATRA 
Why is my lord enraged against his love?

MARK ANTONY 
Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
With her prepared nails.

Exit CLEOPATRA

'Tis well thou'rt gone,
If it be well to live; but better 'twere
Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!

Exit

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.

Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN 
CLEOPATRA 
Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
Was never so emboss'd.

CHARMIAN 
To the monument!
There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting
Than greatness going off.

CLEOPATRA 
To the monument!
Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
And bring me how he takes my death.
To the monument!

Exeunt

SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.

Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS 
MARK ANTONY 
Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

EROS 
Ay, noble lord.

MARK ANTONY 
Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory
With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.

EROS 
Ay, my lord,

MARK ANTONY 
That which is now a horse, even with a thought
The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
As water is in water.

EROS 
It does, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
Even such a body: here I am Antony:
Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
Unto an enemy's triumph.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
Ourselves to end ourselves.

Enter MARDIAN

O! thy vile lady!
She has robb'd me of my sword.

MARDIAN 
No, Antony;
My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
With thine entirely.

MARK ANTONY 
Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.

MARDIAN 
Death of one person can be paid but once,
And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
The name of Antony; it was divided
Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
Thy name so buried in her.

MARK ANTONY 
Dead, then?

MARDIAN 
Dead.

MARK ANTONY 
Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
And we must sleep.

To MARDIAN

That thou depart'st hence safe,
Does pay thy labour richly; go.

Exit MARDIAN

Off, pluck off:
The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.

Exit EROS

I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
All length is torture: since the torch is out,
Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:
Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!

Re-enter EROS

EROS 
What would my lord?

MARK ANTONY 
Since Cleopatra died,
I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
The courage of a woman; less noble mind
Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
That, when the exigent should come, which now
Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
The inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
Put colour in thy cheek.

EROS 
The gods withhold me!
Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?

MARK ANTONY 
Eros,
Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
His corrigible neck, his face subdued
To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
His baseness that ensued?

EROS 
I would not see't.

MARK ANTONY 
Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
Most useful for thy country.

EROS 
O, sir, pardon me!

MARK ANTONY 
When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
Or thy precedent services are all
But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.

EROS 
Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

MARK ANTONY 
Lo thee!

Turning from him

EROS 
My sword is drawn.

MARK ANTONY 
Then let it do at once
The thing why thou hast drawn it.

EROS 
My dear master,
My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

MARK ANTONY 
'Tis said, man; and farewell.

EROS 
Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

MARK ANTONY 
Now, Eros.

EROS 
Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
Of Antony's death.

Kills himself

MARK ANTONY 
Thrice-nobler than myself!
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
Have by their brave instruction got upon me
A nobleness in record: but I will be
A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus

Falling on his sword

I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!

Enter DERCETAS and Guard

First Guard 
What's the noise?

MARK ANTONY 
I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
Of what I have begun.

Second Guard 
The star is fall'n.

First Guard 
And time is at his period.

All 
Alas, and woe!

MARK ANTONY 
Let him that loves me strike me dead.

First Guard 
Not I.

Second Guard 
Nor I.

Third Guard 
Nor any one.

Exeunt Guard

DERCETAS 
Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
Shall enter me with him.

Enter DIOMEDES

DIOMEDES 
Where's Antony?

DERCETAS 
There, Diomed there.

DIOMEDES 
Lives he?
Wilt thou not answer, man?

Exit DERCETAS

MARK ANTONY 
Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
Sufficing strokes for death.

DIOMEDES 
Most absolute lord,
My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

MARK ANTONY 
When did she send thee?

DIOMEDES 
Now, my lord.

MARK ANTONY 
Where is she?

DIOMEDES 
Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
Which never shall be found--you did suspect
She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
I dread, too late.

MARK ANTONY 
Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.

DIOMEDES 
What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
Come, your lord calls!

Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY

MARK ANTONY 
Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
'Tis the last service that I shall command you.

First Guard 
Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
All your true followers out.

All 
Most heavy day!

MARK ANTONY 
Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
And have my thanks for all.

Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY

SCENE XV. The same. A monument.

Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS 
CLEOPATRA 
O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

CHARMIAN 
Be comforted, dear madam.

CLEOPATRA 
No, I will not:
All strange and terrible events are welcome,
But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
As that which makes it.

Enter, below, DIOMEDES

How now! is he dead?

DIOMEDES 
His death's upon him, but not dead.
Look out o' the other side your monument;
His guard have brought him thither.

Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard

CLEOPATRA 
O sun,
Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
darkling stand
The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.

MARK ANTONY 
Peace!
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.

CLEOPATRA 
So it should be, that none but Antony
Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

MARK ANTONY 
I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
I here importune death awhile, until
Of many thousand kisses the poor last
I lay up thy lips.

CLEOPATRA 
I dare not, dear,--
Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
serpents, have
Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
Assist, good friends.

MARK ANTONY 
O, quick, or I am gone.

CLEOPATRA 
Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;

They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA

And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
Thus would I wear them out.

All 
A heavy sight!

MARK ANTONY 
I am dying, Egypt, dying:
Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

CLEOPATRA 
No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
Provoked by my offence.

MARK ANTONY 
One word, sweet queen:
Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!

CLEOPATRA 
They do not go together.

MARK ANTONY 
Gentle, hear me:
None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA 
My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
None about Caesar.

MARK ANTONY 
The miserable change now at my end
Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
In feeding them with those my former fortunes
Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
The noblest; and do now not basely die,
Not cowardly put off my helmet to
My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
I can no more.

CLEOPATRA 
Noblest of men, woo't die?
Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
In this dull world, which in thy absence is
No better than a sty? O, see, my women,

MARK ANTONY dies

The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
And there is nothing left remarkable
Beneath the visiting moon.

Faints

CHARMIAN 
O, quietness, lady!

IRAS 
She is dead too, our sovereign.

CHARMIAN 
Lady!

IRAS 
Madam!

CHARMIAN 
O madam, madam, madam!

IRAS 
Royal Egypt, Empress!

CHARMIAN 
Peace, peace, Iras!

CLEOPATRA 
No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
By such poor passion as the maid that milks
And does the meanest chares. It were for me
To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
To tell them that this world did equal theirs
Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
Patience is scottish, and impatience does
Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
To rush into the secret house of death,
Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
what's noble,
Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
But resolution, and the briefest end.

Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body


ACT V
SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war 
OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
The pauses that he makes.

DOLABELLA 
Caesar, I shall.

Exit

Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
Appear thus to us?

DERCETAS 
I am call'd Dercetas;
Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
He was my master; and I wore my life
To spend upon his haters. If thou please
To take me to thee, as I was to him
I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
I yield thee up my life.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
What is't thou say'st?

DERCETAS 
I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
The breaking of so great a thing should make
A greater crack: the round world
Should have shook lions into civil streets,
And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
Is not a single doom; in the name lay
A moiety of the world.

DERCETAS 
He is dead, Caesar:
Not by a public minister of justice,
Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
With his most noble blood.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Look you sad, friends?
The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
To wash the eyes of kings.

AGRIPPA 
And strange it is,
That nature must compel us to lament
Our most persisted deeds.

MECAENAS 
His taints and honours
Waged equal with him.

AGRIPPA 
A rarer spirit never
Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.

MECAENAS 
When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
He needs must see himself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
O Antony!
I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
Have shown to thee such a declining day,
Or look on thine; we could not stall together
In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
That thou, my brother, my competitor
In top of all design, my mate in empire,
Friend and companion in the front of war,
The arm of mine own body, and the heart
Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
Unreconciliable, should divide
Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
But I will tell you at some meeter season:

Enter an Egyptian

The business of this man looks out of him;
We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?

Egyptian 
A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
Confined in all she has, her monument,
Of thy intents desires instruction,
That she preparedly may frame herself
To the way she's forced to.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Bid her have good heart:
She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
How honourable and how kindly we
Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
To be ungentle.

Egyptian 
So the gods preserve thee!

Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR 
Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
The quality of her passion shall require,
Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
And with your speediest bring us what she says,
And how you find of her.

PROCULEIUS 
Caesar, I shall.

Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR
